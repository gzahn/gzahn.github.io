Major Points:

- Early Earth conditions and the rise of oxygen
- Redox reactions
- Metabolism
- Environmental change relates to evolutionary pressures
- Mutations + Heritability + Selection Coefficient = Evolution
- Evolution is not goal oriented
- How to read a phylogeny (clades, ancestral nodes, sisters)
- Homologies (Orthologs and Paralogs) vs Analogies
- Organisms' evolutionary history is documented in their genomes
- Horizontal (Lateral) Gene Transfer
- Phylogenies are testable and falsifiable explanations of observed diversity (hypotheses) that make predictions
