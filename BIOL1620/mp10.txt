Major Points:
- Describe common ancestor of all plants
- How are charophytes related to plants and why are they NOT plants?
- Derived traits of plants = alternation of generations, walled spores in sporangia, multicellular gametangia, apical meristems
- What enabled transition of plants to land? What were challenges and benefits of life on land?
- Evolutionary trends in plants (reduced gametophyte, increased sporophyte... spores -> vascular tissue -> seeds -> flowers)
- Timeline of those "events"
- Four major plant groups (non-vascular, seedless vascular, naked seed, flowering seed)
- Plant phyla: Liverworts, Hornworts, Mosses, Lycophytes, Pterophytes(Monilophytes), Ginkgos, Cycads, Gnetophytes, Conifers, Anthophytes)
- For those phyla, know: major anatomy, life cycle, rough timeline of emergence in fossil record)
