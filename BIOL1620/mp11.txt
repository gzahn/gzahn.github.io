Major Points:
- When, Why/How did seeds evolve?
- Seeds are diploid embryo surrounded by haploid gametophyte tissue and some food in a protective coating
- Why are seeds handy?
- Derived traits of seed plants
- Life cycles include heterospory and pollen
- Gametophyte makes gametes, Sporophyte makes spores, spores grow into gametophyte
- Heterosporous plants have two DIFFERENT types of spores (meaning two different gametopyhytes)
- Pollen is the gametophyte generation (makes male gametes)
- Gymnosperms vs Angiosperms
- Angiosperm double-fertilization can lead to triploidy
