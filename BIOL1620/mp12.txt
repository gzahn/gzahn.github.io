Major Points:
- Define "behavior"
- Bad ideas in study of behavior: Nature vs nurture, reinforcement "theory", universality
- Proximate vs ultimate (evolutionary) causes for behaviors
	proximate = immediate stimuli, physiological and anatomical mechanisms
	ultimate = evolutionary significance of a behavior (why that behavior evolved)
- Types of behavior:
	- fixed action pattern
	- taxis / kinesis
	- learned (habituation, imprinting, spatial, associative)
- Classical vs Operant conditioning
- Superstition = False signal still elicits a behavior, this makes sense evolutionarily, even though it seems dumb
- Cognition seems to be somewhat rare
- Behaviors influence fitness and are selected for (or against) by the environment like any other trait
- Behavioral traits are rarely the result of a single gene though
- How does the story of cuckoos depend on the evolutionary pressures on behaviors?
