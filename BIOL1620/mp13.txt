Major Points:
- Ecology is study of interactions between organisms and environment
- Increasing scale of complexity: Organismal -> Population -> Community -> Ecosystem -> Landscape -> Global
- Climate is not weather
- Major biome categories (Tundra, Desert, Tropical Rainforest, etc) are broadly shaped by temperature and precipitation (climate!)
- What controls species distributions? Dispersal barriers and environmental filtering
- Ecological change and evolutionary change feed off of each other

- How do you read a chart that shows uncertainty?
- What is a "model?"
- What are the causes of current rapid climate change?
- What does population genetics reveal about extant human population(s)?
