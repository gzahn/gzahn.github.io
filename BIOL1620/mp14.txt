Major Points:
- Population vs Community
- Symbioses are a spectrum from Parisitism to Mutualism
- Competition leads to resource partitioning because competition is bad for everyone involved
- "Niche" is how an organism makes a living. Realized niche is fundamental niche minus competition
- Trophic structure is limited by thermodynamics
- Why are big fierce animals rare?
- How to define and measure biodiversity? (richness and evenness)
- How to compare similarity of two communities with a bunch of different species? (How to read an ordination plot)
- Community ecology in "real life"
	- Microbiomes
	- Forensics
- Attine ants as a model system to study ecological interactions (Behaviors, Pathogens, Competition, Population growth, coevolution, symbioses, microbiomes, etc.)
