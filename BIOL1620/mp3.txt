Major Points:
- Nature of Science
- Fact, Hypothesis, Law, Theory
- Laws are descriptions that work so well we can use them for cool stuff
- Theories are explanations that work so well we can build new laws and theories off of them
- Lamarckian vs Darwinian evolution
- Mechanisms of evolution (Mutation, Selection, Gene Flow, Genetic Drift)
- Natural selection can only work with what is has (historical constraints) ...giraffe dissection
- All so-called "arguments" against evolution have so far been really pathetic
- Strong evidence that chimpanzees are humans' closest living relative
