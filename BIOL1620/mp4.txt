Major Points:
- Bacteria and archaea
- Commonalities and differences
- Lateral (horizontal) gene transfer
- Where do plastids (chloroplasts, mitochondria, etc) come from and what evidence do we have for our theory?
- What is symbiosis?
- Metabolic cooperation ... metabolic tasks distributed among different species
- Global importance of "prokaryotes" (What processes do they control? Why is basic research worth pursuing?)
