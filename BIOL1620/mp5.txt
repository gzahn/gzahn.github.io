Major Points:
- Most eukaryotes are "protists"
- "Protists" are polyphyletic and a negatively defined group
- Eukaryotes are broadly divided into "supergroups" (your textbook is out of date on eukaryote phylogeny)
	- But we will still look at some supergroups and learn what makes each a "group"
	- SAR: Stramenophiles, Alveolates, Rhizarians
	- Archiplastida: shared plastid origin
	- Excavata
	- Amoebozoa
	- Opisthokonta
- Secondary endosymbiosis (and tertiary) ... What are the indicators and evidence
- "Protists" are ecologically and medically important (what are some examples?)
