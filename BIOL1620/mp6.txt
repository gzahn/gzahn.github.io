Major Points:
- Defining characteristics of metazoans
	- Nutirtional mode
	- Multi-cellularity
	- Sexual reproduction with dominant diploid stage (usually)
	- Developmental genes
- Evolutionary timeline of metazoans
- HOW are metazoans multicellular? How did that evolve?
- Metazoan fossil evidence
- Cambrian radiation (when?, why?, so what?)
- Animal body plans (symmetry? tissues? body cavity?)
- Developmental biology (how did "tube" form?, tissue differentiation, "body plan" Hox genes code for transcription factors)
- How do we build animal phylogenies today vs how did we used to?
