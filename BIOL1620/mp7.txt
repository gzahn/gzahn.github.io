Major Points:
- Most metazoans are invertebrates
- We're only covering SOME of the phyla of metazoans...of the ones we cover, know:
	- Major groups within that phylum
	- Life cycles
	- Symmetry, tissues, body cavity
	- What ties them together as a group?
	- What traits did the common ancestor of metazoans have?
- We go a bit deeper into one phylum, Chordata:
	- What 4 traits make a chordate a chordate?
	- Evolutionary history and major developmental hallmarks of Chordata
		- Chordates, Craniates, Vertebrates, Gnathostomes, Tetrapods, Amniotes, Mammals
	- How do humans fit these traits?
	- Like ALL other extant clades, true phylogeny of Chordata is made up of mostly extinct species
	- How did tetrapods transition to land? When? Where?
	- Birds are totally dinosaurs, yo!
- We go further into one group of chordates, the mammals:
	- What are derived traits of mammals?
	- Evolutionary trends in mammals
	- Evolutionary convergence of Monotremes, Marsupials, Eutherians
	- Hominids vs Hominins
	- Evolutionary trends of hominins
	- Interbreeding between humans and other hominins
	- Hominin expansion from Africa
