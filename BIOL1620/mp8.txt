Major Points:
- Main fungal phyla (Chytrids, Zygos, Glomeros, Ascos, Basidios)
- Fungi are closely related to metazoans
- Fungal body plans (tiny blob, filament, or both)
- Life cycle of dikarya is a bit weird (karyogamy does not immediately follow plasmogamy)
- Sexual AND asexual reproduction (advantages of each?)
- Global importance of fungi
- Lichens are fungi that farm green stuff (several species make up a single organism)
- Fungi are expert symbionts (all plants depend on them)
