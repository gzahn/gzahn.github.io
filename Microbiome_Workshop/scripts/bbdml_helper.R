# automate some aspects of bbdml for taxa found to be differentially abundant via differentialTest()
# requires corncob, tidyverse, broom, purrr

# multi_bbdml() takes the output from corncob::differentialTest() along with a single mu and phi predictor variable
# and returns a list of bbdml objects for each taxon that had significant differential abundance.
# This is different from differentialTest() in that not just the summary objects are returned.
# This allows for plots to be generated programmatically using the plot_multi_bbdml() function, which
# takes the output from multi_bbdml() and returns a single bbdml plot for each significant taxon

# example usage found below:
