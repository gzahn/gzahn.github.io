	abstract = {Beneficial microbes such as plant mutualistic fungi, hold the promise of ameliorating challenges faced in native plant conservation such as disease management. As an alternative to costly chemical pest control, conservation efforts could potentially harness the benefits of plant mutualistic fungi to aid in defense and disease resistance, but there are few tests of this notion. We set out to test the efficacy of controlling a common foliar pathogen, the powdery mildew Neoerysiphe galeopsidis, by inoculating the endangered Hawaiian plant species Phyllostegia kaalaensis with potentially beneficial members of its wild-type mycobiome. We tested whether inoculating plants with above or belowground fungal mutualists, or both, led to increased disease resistance in the host. We found that while all treatments reduced average disease incidence, colonization by the foliar yeast Moesziomyces aphidis was the only treatment to do so significantly. These results provide an exciting new strategy for plant conservation practices.},

	abstract = {To study biogeography and other ecological patterns of microorganisms, including fungi, scientists have been using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as representations of species or species hypotheses. However, when defined by 97\% sequence similarity cutoff at an accepted barcode locus such as 16S in bacteria or ITS in fungi, these OTUs can obscure biogeographic patterns, mask taxonomic diversity, and hinder meta-analyses. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) have been proposed to alleviate all of these issues and have been shown to do so in bacteria. Analyzing ASVs is just emerging as a common practice among fungal studies, and it is unclear whether the benefits found in bacterial studies of using such an approach carryover to fungi. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of Hawaiian fungi by analyzing ITS1 amplicon sequencing data as ASVs and exploring ecological patterns. These surveys spanned three island groups and five ecosystems combined into the first comprehensive Hawaiian Mycobiome ASV Database. Our results show that ASVs can be used to combine fungal ITS surveys, increase reproducibility, and maintain the broad ecological patterns observed with OTUs, including diversity orderings. Additionally, the ASVs that comprise some of the most common OTUs in our database reveals some island specialists, indicating that traditional OTU clustering can obscure important biogeographic patterns. We recommend that future fungal studies, especially those aimed at assessing biogeography, analyze ASVs rather than OTUs. We conclude that similar to bacterial studies, ASVs improve reproducibility and data sharing for fungal studies.},

Many studies have examined these endophytes within a single plant species and/or at small spatial scales, but landscape-scale variables that determine their community composition are not well understood, either across geographic space, across climatic conditions, or in the context of host plant phylogeny. Here, we evaluate the contributions of these variables to endophyte beta diversity using a survey of foliar endophytic fungi in native Hawaiian dicots sampled across the Hawaiian archipelago. We used Illumina technology to sequence fungal ITS1 amplicons to characterize foliar endophyte communities across five islands and 80 host plant genera. We found that communities of foliar endophytic fungi showed strong geographic structuring between distances of 7 and 36 km. Endophyte community structure was most strongly associated with host plant phylogeny and evapotranspiration, and was also significantly associated with NDVI, elevation and solar radiation. Additionally, our bipartite network analysis revealed that the five islands we sampled each harboured significantly specialized endophyte communities. These results demonstrate how the interaction of factors at large and small spatial and phylogenetic scales shapes fungal symbiont communities.},

	abstract = {There has been very little effort to incorporate foliar microbiomes into plant conservation efforts even though foliar endophytes are critically important to the fitness and function of hosts. Many critically endangered plants that have been extirpated from the wild are dependent on regular fungicidal applications in greenhouses that cannot be maintained for remote out-planted populations, which quickly perish. These fungicides negatively impact potentially beneficial fungal symbionts, which may reduce plant defenses to pathogens once fungicide treatments are stopped. Using the host/parasite system of Phyllostegia kaalaensis and Neoerysiphe galeopsidis, we conducted experiments to test total foliar microbiome transplants from healthy wild relatives onto fungicide-dependent endangered plants in an attempt to mitigate disease and reduce dependency on fungicides. Plants were treated with total microbiome transplants or cultured subsets of this community and monitored for disease severity. High-throughput DNA screening of fungal ITS1 rDNA was used to track the leaf-associated fungal communities and evaluate the effectiveness of transplantation methods. Individuals receiving traditionally isolated fungal treatments showed no improvement, but those receiving applications of a simple leaf slurry containing an uncultured fungal community showed significant disease reduction, to which we partially attribute an increase in the mycoparasitic Pseudozyma aphidis. These results were replicated in two independent experimental rounds. Treated plants have since been moved to a native habitat and, as of this writing, remain disease-free. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple low-tech method for transferring beneficial microbes from healthy wild plants to greenhouse-raised plants with reduced symbiotic microbiota. This technique was effective at reducing disease, and in conferring increased survival to an out-planted population of critically endangered plants. It was not effective in a closely related plant. Plant conservation efforts should strive to include foliar microbes as part of comprehensive management plans.},

Designed to preserve the genetic information for organisms of interest, these banks also indirectly preserve organismsâ associated microbiomes, including fungi associated with plant tissues. Studies of fungal biodiversity lag far behind those of macroorganisms, such as plants, and estimates of global fungal richness are still widely debated. Utilizing previously collected specimens to study patterns of fungal diversity could significantly increase our understanding of overall patterns of biodiversity from snapshots in time. Here, we investigated the fungi inhabiting the phylloplane among species of the endemic Hawaiian plant genus, Clermontia (Campanulaceae). Utilizing next generation DNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered approximately 1,780 fungal operational taxonomic units from just 20 DNA bank samples collected throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. Using these historical samples, we tested the macroecological pattern of decreasing community similarity with decreasing geographic proximity. We found a significant distance decay pattern among Clermontia associated fungal communities. This study provides the first insights into elucidating patterns of microbial diversity through the use of DNA bank repository samples.},

We inoculated the sterile plants with fully-factorial combinations of four fungal isolates, then measured flowering time and reproductive allocation for each treatment group under normal and water-stressed conditions. All plants inoculated with foliar fungi had significantly later flowering and greater seed mass than the sterile control groups. The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased.

We investigated the fungal communities associated with the seagrass Enhalus acoroides collected from Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia to test the hypothesis that fungal communities are homogeneous throughout the study area. Seagrass samples were separated into different structures (leaves, roots, and rhizomes), and a sediment sample was collected next to each plant. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 and subsequent analysis revealed significant differences in fungal communities collected from different locations and different structures. We show a significant pattern of distance decay, with samples collected close to each other having more similar fungal communities in comparison with those that are more distant, indicating dispersal limitations and/or differences in habitat type are contributing to the observed biogeographic patterns. These results add to our understanding of the seagrass ecosystem in an understudied region of the world that is also the global epicenter of seagrass diversity.

However, compared with charismatic animals and plants, the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi have been little explored. Here we used high-resolution sequencing to assess endemicity patterns, global change vulnerability and conservation priority areas for functional groups of soil fungi based on six global surveys using a high-resolution, long-read metabarcoding approach. We found that the endemicity of all fungi and most functional groups peaks in tropical habitats, including Amazonia, Yucatan, West-Central Africa, Sri Lanka and New Caledonia, with a negligible island effect compared with plants and animals. We also found that fungi are predominantly vulnerable to drought, heat and land cover change, particularly in dry tropical regions with high human population density. Fungal conservation areas of highest priority include herbaceous wetlands, tropical forests and woodlands. We stress that more attention should be focused on the conservation of fungi, especially root symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi in tropical regions as well as unicellular early-diverging groups and macrofungi in general. Given the low overlap between the endemicity of fungi and macroorganisms, but high conservation needs in both groups, detailed analyses on distribution and conservation requirements are warranted for other microorganisms and soil organisms.},

ITS1 rDNA barcoding and sequencing of 113 trees detected a richness of 1,637 FEs representing 5 phyla, 223 genera, and 200 species. Variation in FE diversity was significantly explained by host taxon and site with considerable overlap in FE communities among taxa.

Twenty-four macroalgae samples, representing four genera, were collected from a Hawaiian mesophotic reef at water depths between 65 and 86 m in the âAuâau Channel, Maui, Hawaiâi. Algal tissues were surveyed for the presence and diversity of fungi by sequencing the ITS1 gene using Illumina technology. Fungi from these algae were then compared to previous fungal surveys conducted in Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems. Twenty-seven percent of the OTUs present on the mesophotic coral ecosystem samples were shared between the marine and terrestrial environment. Subsequent analyses indicated that host species of algae significantly differentiate fungal community composition. This work demonstrates yet another understudied habitat with a moderate diversity of fungi that should be considered when estimating global fungal diversity.},

osteosperma (Torr.) Little (Utah juniper) being the most common tree in the state of Utah. Wildfires
frequently impact these woodlands. Dead Utah juniper trees (n = 16), which were killed by different
wildfires over a range of 21 years, were harvested to research the relationship between abiotic and biotic
influencers of decomposition. Specifically, dead juniper trunks were divided into four segments to research
essential oil (volatile oil) content and composition, water content, boring insect populations, and fungal and
bacterial colonization. Volatile oil samples, produced through steam distillation of trunk portions, were
analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Prominent compounds include Î±-cedrene (10.4\%), cis-thujopsene
(19.8\%), widdrol (7.6\%), cedrol (20.1\%), and cedr-8-en-13-ol (5.7\%). Based on the year that trees were
burnt, older trees displayed a trend of containing a higher yield of volatile oil. Essential oil positively
correlated with water content (Spearmanâs correlation test: Ï = 0.519, p = 0.039). Evidence of boring insects
from the family Buprestidae were found in most trunk samples (75\%). DNA sequencing identified 1258
bacterial and 326 fungal taxa, with samples dominated by fungal reads. Fungal communities were
dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and bacterial communities by Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The presence of two volatile compounds, Î±- and Î²-acorenol, was
demonstrated to be a negative predictor of fungal diversity (GLM; p = 0.017). The content or composition
of volatile oil demonstrated little-to-no impact on bacterial diversity or insect populations. This study
establishes that volatile oil remains in the trunk wood of Utah juniper trees for at least 20 years, but has
little predictive impact on biotic influencers of decomposition.},

	abstract = {Fungi are ubiquitous and often abundant components of virtually all ecosystems on Earth, serving a diversity of functions. While there is clear evidence that fungal-mediated processes can influence environmental conditions, and in turn select for specific fungi, it is less clear how fungi respond to environmental fluxes over relatively long time frames. Here we set out to examine changes in airborne fungi collected over the course of 13 y, which is the longest sampling time to date. Air filter samples were collected from the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) on Hawaii Island, and analyzed using Illumina amplicon sequencing. As a study site, MLO is unique because of its geographic isolation and high elevation, making it an ideal place to capture global trends in climate and aerobiota. We found that the fungal aerobiota sampled at MLO had high species turnover, but compositional similarity did not decrease as a function of time between samples. We attribute these patterns to neutral processes such as idiosyncratic dispersal timing and trajectories. Furthermore, the composition of fungi at any given point was not significantly influenced by any local or global environmental variables we examined. This, and our additional finding of a core set of persistent fungi during our entire sampling period, indicates some degree of stability among fungi in the face of natural environmental fluctuations and human-associated global change. We conclude that the movement of fungi through the atmosphere is a relatively stochastic process.},

	abstract = {Aim

To test whether or not fungal communities associated with the widespread seagrass, Syringodium isoetifolium can be differentiated on either side of Wallace's line, a boundary line separating Asian and Australasian fauna. Additionally, we examine whether host multilocus genotype predicts fungal community composition.


Location

A total of 77 samples were collected from 14 sampling sites spanning the Indonesian archipelago.


Methods

We sequenced the fungal ITS1 gene using Illumia MiSeq technology and used a clustering-free Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm to infer ribosomal sequence variants. Data were analysed via non-metric multidimensional scaling, Mantel tests and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Binary and quantitative null models were used to determine whether results significantly deviated from random. Host genotype was determined by genotyping at 18 microsatellite loci and standard genetic analysis was performed in the R package APE.


Results

Significant differences in fungal community composition were detected on either side of Wallace's line (pÂ =Â {\textless}.001 R2Â =Â .040). A significant distance decay of similarity pattern was observed between ribosomal sequence variants and geographical distance (pÂ =Â .001 R2Â =Â .227) and several fungal ribosomal sequence variants were significantly associated with sampling sites found either east or west of Wallace's line.


Main conclusions

Fungi are generally considered to have excellent dispersal potentials and marine fungi have the potential to disperse far and wide in an environment that has no obvious barriers to dispersal. Despite this assumed excellent dispersal potential, we show that fungal communities on either side of Wallace's line are significantly different from one another. We speculate that limited dispersal and differences in habitat type are responsible for the observed pattern. Work examining biogeographical patterns in marine fungi is still in its infancy and further research is required to fully understand marine fungal biogeography.},

Larger and older colonies have been shown to host a higher diversity of microbial taxa and this has been suggested to be a consequence of their more numerous, complex and varied micro-niches available. However, the effects of host age on community structure and diversity of microbial associates remain equivocal in the few studies performed to date. To test this relationship more robustly, we use established techniques to accurately determine coral host age by quantifying annual skeletal banding patterns, and utilise high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively characterise the microbiome of the common reef-building coral, Porites lutea. Our results indicate no clear link between coral age and microbial diversity or richness. Different sites display distinct age-dependent diversity patterns, with more anthropogenically impacted reefs appearing to show a winnowing of microbial diversity with host age, possibly a consequence of corals adapting to degraded environments. Less impacted sites do not show a signature of winnowing, and we observe increases in microbial richness and diversity as the host ages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that corals of a similar age from the same reef can show very different microbial richness and diversity.},

Here, we investigated the fungal communities associated with the canopy forming macroalga Sargassum ilicifolium(Turner) C. Argardh (1820) in Singapore. We collected eight S. ilicifolium thalli from each of eight island locations and separated them into three structuresâleaves, holdfast and vesicles. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and subsequent analyses revealed weak but significant differences in fungal community composition from different structures. Fungal communities were also significantly different among sampling localities, even over relatively small spatial scales (â¤ 12 km). Unsurprisingly, all structures from all localities were dominated by unclassified fungi. Our findings demonstrate the potential of marine environments to act as reservoirs of undocumented biodiversity that harbour many novel fungal taxa. These unclassified fungi highlight the need to look beyond terrestrial ecosystems in well-studied regions of the world, and to fully characterize fungal biodiversity in hotspots such as Southeast Asia for better understanding the roles they play in promoting and maintaining life on our planet.},

Here we show that bacterial communities associated with the reef-building coral, Pocillopora acuta, from nine offshore islands in an urbanised coral reef ecosystem (Singapore) can diverge sharply and are significantly different among sampling locations. We suggest that small-scale environmental factors such as prevailing surface currents and wind direction, even over short distances ({\textless} 1 km), are responsible for generating bacterial community structure.

However, seagrass meadows globally are under severe duress due to both climate change and anthropogenic activities. We characterized the mycobiome of Halophilia ovalis at seven sites in the Malay Peninsula using ITS1 rDNA amplicon sequences and investigated differences in fungal community structure. We found that geographic location was a significant factor shaping fungal communities and that marine sediment harboured significantly higher diversity when compared to H. ovalis leaves, roots and rhizomes. Taken together, it is likely that locality rather than specific plant structure determines fungal community structure in H. ovalis. Because the plant mycobiome is known to exert a strong effect on plant health, to maximize the success of future seagrass transplantation and restoration work we propose that these efforts consider the importance of seagrass mycobiomes at all stages.},
