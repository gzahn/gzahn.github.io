# About me / CV
#### Browse this site for information about my research or [follow this link](https://github.com/gzahn/Profile/blob/master/CV_TT.pdf) for my (fairly) current C.V.

##### I am an Assistant Professor of Mycology at Utah Valley University. My students and I are investigating extremophilic fungi, the effect of fire severity on forest soil microbial community recovery, and the microbes associated with coral ecosystems under climate change.

##### I received my PhD in Biology at the University of Arkansas, where my research focused on the distributional and functional ecology of slime molds.  I received my B.S. in Biology at Missouri State University where I became interested in conservation.  I am broadly interested in microbial ecology and biogeochemistry, but am particularly drawn to applied questions and manipulative experimentation.

##### When I am not playing with my microbes I enjoy hiking, brewing, kayaking for days at  a time, and cooking. Also, I have the best dog ever, Dr. Indiana Jones.
