# **About me / [CV](https://gzahn.github.io/about-me/CV.pdf)**
### **Browse this site for information about our research or [follow this link](https://gzahn.github.io/about-me/CV.pdf) for my (fairly) current C.V.**

#### **I offer a wide range of data analytics and microbial bioinformatics consultancy services. If you are interested please get in touch.**

### I am an Assistant Professor of Mycology at Utah Valley University. My students and I are investigating extremophilic fungi, the effect of fire severity on forest soil microbial community recovery, and the microbes associated with coral ecosystems under climate change. I am broadly interested in microbial ecology and biogeochemistry, but am particularly drawn to applied questions and manipulative experimentation.

### I received my PhD in Biology at the University of Arkansas, where my research focused on the distributional and functional ecology of slime molds.  I received my B.S. in Biology at Missouri State University where I became interested in conservation.  

### When I am not playing with my microbes I enjoy hiking, brewing, kayaking for days at  a time, and cooking.

Since my students keep finding these photos of me on the dark web, I'm putting them here to get it out of the way and steal their sense of victory.
