Do you want to capture your very own wild yeast culture or strain? With
the right tools, and these *Three Easy Methods*,* *you can capture yeast
right in your own backyard.

Before proceeding, checkout *Bootleg Biology’s Backyard Yeast Wrangling
Tool Kit
<https://bootlegbiology.com/backyard-yeast-wrangling-tool-kit/>*. Everything
the experimental homebrewer needs to capture wild bugs, create agar
plates, and isolate wild yeast.

Wild Yeast Starter Jar


      Method #1: Wild Yeast Starter Jars

The following is how S. arlingtonesis
<https://bootlegbiology.com/available-yeast/local-yeast/arlington-va/>
was sourced from the ambient air in Arlington, VA. This is a
modification of The Mad Fermentationist’s Ambient-Spontaneous Yeast
Starters
<http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2011/04/ambient-spontaneous-yeast-starters.html> technique.
The eventual goal is to isolate a strain, so changes have been made.

Wild Yeast Starter Jars

Wild Yeast Starter Jars

 1. Create a starter as you typically would for a homebrew batch of
    beer.  For ease, use a 1/10 ratio of filtered water to malt extract
    (1.040 gravity). A weaker gravity will work just as well, use
    whatever you’re comfortable with. Create enough volume to fill up
    three or more jars half way (the more jars, the more likelihood of
    success).
 2. Boil the liquid mixture with a small amount of hops for at least 20
    mins. You can boil longer with more hops, but you’re just trying to
    sterilize the wort and pickup the antibacterial properties from the
    hops (Hops will primarily slow the growth of Lactobacillus. Of
    course, you may in the future want to cultivate Lacto to have your
    own sour strain. But let’s save that for another day).
 3. Once the liquid has cooled enough so that you won’t burn yourself if
    it spills, pour into sanitized mason jars. /If you have a pH meter,
    now’s a good time to check the pH level; this will be helpful later
    when verifying if the right kind of fermentation occurred/.
 4. Cover with cheese cloth (to prevent insects from crashing your yeast
    party) and keep in place by screwing on the jar lids or tightening
    with a rubber band.
 5. Place the jars overnight outside, in a herb or vegetable garden,
    under a fruit tree or even in your beer cave. Any place with good
    air flow, vibrant vegetation and free of curious woodland creatures
    will work fine. Please don’t put near a septic tank, an alley or
    other potentially contaminated place (it’s disgusting, and probably
    not safe).

*Bring ’em Back Home: Day Two*

 1. The next day, bring in any cooled jars left outside.
 2. Remove the cheese cloth. You can leave the liquid in the jars, but
    if you do so make sure to cover the surface of the liquid to prevent
    contact with the air. This will help reduce the chances of surface
    mold growth. You’ll probably still get mold, but this’ll probably
    make you feel more pro-active. Another option is to pour the liquid
    into a growler or jug and cover with an air lock.
 3. Leave in a dark, room temperature place.

*Monitor For Signs of Fermentation: Day One + Two Weeks*

There's A Fungus Among Us
<https://bootlegbiology.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-02-25_1361813596.jpg>

There’s A Fungus Among Us

 1. Within a few days there should be the tell-tale signs of
    fermentation, with a small amount of CO2 bubbles coming to the
    surface of your jar or minor air lock activity. Don’t worry if you
    don’t see signs of activity quickly. Compared to a normal starter
    that has had billions of yeast cells accustomed to barley sugar, a
    comparatively small amount of wild microbes have started colonizing
    your wild yeast starters.
 2. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TASTE until fully fermented out. Never taste any
    starter unless active fermentation has been verified for a sustained
    period of days.
 3. Roughly two weeks (assuming each jar or growler has fermented out)
    it should be safe to taste. Make sure you scrape off any mold,
    unless that’s your thing (please just do it). The presence of mold
    doesn’t mean your wild yeast starter is ruined, it’s just a common
    part of the process. If you have a pH meter, compare the current pH
    to the reading you took before putting the jars outside. If the pH
    dropped significantly you’re probably safe. /If the pH increased for
    any of your jars, discard the liquid and move on./
 4. Use the smell test first. If it smells good (honey, citrus, etc),
    you’ve probably got something fun. Creamed corn is a common aroma
    from certain wild yeast, and these strains often do not flocculate
    well. If it smells good, use a sanitized pipette to pull a sample
    from underneath the surface. If it tastes remotely palatable, and
    has dropped clear…you likely have something *INCREDIBLY AWESOME*.
 5. You’re now ready to *create agar plates
    <https://bootlegbiology.com/diy/creating-plates/>* so you can
    isolate your own yeast. You know you want to.

    Uninvited Fungus

    EDITOR’S NOTE: Always practice common sense. If it smells horrible,
    and looks horrible just don’t taste it. Try one of your other test
    jars. If you look at the picture above, the jar in the middle has a
    reddish/orangeish hue. A good sign that this jar should not be
    tasted. Good thing, because it eventually grew a friggin MUSHROOM.
    That is all.

  * EDITOR’S NOTE #2: After reading this page, *Ingo*, mentioned that he
    adds lactic acid to lower the pH when making sourdough starters. If
    you’re worried about uninvited guests in your Wild Yeast Starter,
    this could be a good route to take. Acidulated malt could be used as
    well.

Wild Yeast From Fruit (icon)


      Method #2: Collecting Samples From Fruit & Vegetables

The microbes that live on fruits are primarily yeasts and fungi, whereas
vegetables typically have lactic-acid-producing “sour” bacteria like
Lactobacillus and Pediococcus in residence. Keep this in mind when
attempting to capture microbes from your local vegetation.

This Fruit Could Make You Loopy

This Fruit Could Make You Loopy

Collecting wild yeast samples from fruit and vegetables is significantly
easier than creating a Wild Yeast Starter (Method #1). Look for fruits
and vegetables that appear to have a fine dusting on their skin or have
started to rot (but don’t use anything that’s already fallen on the
ground!). Even if dust isn’t present, you’re pretty much guaranteed to
collect some amount of wild yeast.

 1. As pictured to the right, it’s as simple as putting several fruit in
    sanitized centrifuge tubes, or glass jam/mason jars.
 2. Pour low gravity (1.010-1.020) unhopped starter wort into the
    container with fruit. Only pour enough to cover the fruit or
    vegetables, but leave enough room for fermentation activity at the
    top. It’s not necessary for fruit to be crushed for fermentation to
    take place.
 3. Wrap the seal between the lid and container with plastic wrap. Shake
    vigorously to aerate, and then leave in a dark, room temperature place.
 4. Within a few days you should see signs of fermentation taking place.
    A yeast sediment will eventually form at the bottom.
 5. It’s time to *create agar plates
    <https://bootlegbiology.com/diy/creating-plates/>*. You can do it!

Wild Yeast Swab (icon)


      Method #3: Sterile Cotton Swabs

Sterile cotton swabs are small and come individually wrapped, making
them easier to travel with than a jar of starter wort.

Going on vacation to a fun locale? Bring a cotton swab and a tube.
Flying internationally and afraid you can’t bring fruit back because of
curious customs officials? Cotton swab, tube. Visiting a sour brewery
willing to give you a tour of their fermentation vessels? You guessed
it. (But don’t be a jerk, either ask them permission to swab in their
brewery, or do it when no one’s looking).

Seriously.

 1. Unwrap sterile cotton swab.
 2. Swab appetizing fruit, fermentation vessel, or enthusiastic volunteer.
 3. Place in a sanitized centrifuge tube, seal, and store in a dark
    place until you’re ready to start fermentation.
 4. Create low gravity (1.010-1.020) unhopped starter wort and pour into
    a sterilized container with a lid, like a jar or another centrifuge
    tube.
 5. Remove your cotton swabs and dunk/swirl the swab end into the
    starter wort several times until the swab is fully saturated, and
    any dust on the swab has made it into the wort.
 6. Within a few days you should see the normal signs of fermentation.
    See, wasn’t that easy?
 7. You guessed it. *Time to create plates
