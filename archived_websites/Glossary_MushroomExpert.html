<p><b><span size="+0">Amyloid</span></b></p>

<p>An amyloid reaction is a bluish-black color change when something is mounted for the microscope in an iodine-based reagent like <a href="#melzers">Melzer's Reagent</a> or <a href="#lugols">Lugol's Reagent</a>.</p>

<p>Spores are typically what is looked at to determine whether the 
reaction is amyloid or notâ€”but other microscopic structures sometimes 
demonstrate the color change, too.</p>

<p>Figuring out what genus your mushroom belongs in is sometimes made easier by knowing whether or not it has amyloid, <a href="#inamyloid">inamyloid</a>, or <a href="#dextrinoid">dextrinoid</a> spores. Examples include <i>Rhodocollybia</i> versus <i>Gymnopus</i> (dextrinoid versus inamyloid spores) and <i>Porpoloma</i> versus <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/tricholoma.html">Tricholoma</a></i> (amyloid versus inamyloid spores).</p>

<p>Identification in the genus <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita.html"><i>Amanita</i></a> is often facilitated by figuring out whether a collection has amyloid or <a href="#inamyloid">inamyloid</a> spores. <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/mycenoid.html">Mycenoid</a>
 mushroom identification sometimes relies on whether spores are amyloid 
or not, as well. The frequently beautiful ornamentation of spores in <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius.html"><i>Lactarius</i></a> and <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/russula.html"><i>Russula</i></a>
 is amyloid, often strongly so, which is why the ornamentation is so 
visible (and why microscopy in these genera requires a Melzer's mount).</p>

<p>A ring of tissue around the upper part of a mushroom's stem, resulting from the collapsing of the <a href="#partial_veil">partial veil</a>,
 is an "annulus" in Mycologeseâ€”or just a "ring" in plain English. Rings 
are extremely variable, ranging from ephemeral and quickly 
disintegrating to sturdy and prominent.</p>

<p>The type of ring a mushroom has is frequently a key feature for identification. Some mushrooms, like <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/macrolepiota_procera.html"><i>Macrolepiota procera</i></a>, have rings which are separable from the stem and can be made to slide up and down. Other rings may be <i><a href="#peronate">peronate</a></i> (sheathlike, like the ring of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_bitorquis.html"><i>Agaricus bitorquis</i></a>), <i>pendant</i> (skirtlike, like the ring of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_magnivelaris.html"><i>Amanita magnivelaris</i></a>), or <i>flaring</i> (like the ring of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/tricholoma_caligatum.html"><i>Tricholoma caligatum</i></a>, illustrated to the left). Additionally, the position of the ring can be important; it may be <i>superior, apical, median, inferior,</i> or <i>basal</i> ("at the very top" to "at the very bottom," in order).</p>

<p>Rings are notoriously absent when they should be present, so be sure 
to have both mature and immature specimens on hand when attempting 
difficult identifications; the partial veil will show up more clearly 
with immature specimens.</p>

<p>In the genus <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita.html"><i>Amanita</i></a>,
 especially, identification keys often ask for an assessment of whether 
the cap is appendiculate or not, but the term is occasionally found 
elsewhere in the mushroom world. The feature is not as stable as one 
might like, however, due to environmental factors like rain and wind, as
 well as the fact that mushrooms do not read identification keys, so it 
is not uncommon to find a mushroom that "should" have an appendiculate 
cap but does not.</p>

<p>"Areolate," in a mushroom mycology context, means "cracked," usually 
in age, like many of us. The cap surface of just about any mushroom can 
become cracked in dry weather conditions, but some species <i>typically</i> develop cracked caps in normal weather conditions. <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/xerocomellus_chrysenteron.html"><i>Xerocomellus chrysenteron</i></a>
 is a well-known example. Sometimes the color of the flesh, revealed 
between the cracks of an areolate cap, is also an important 
identification feature.</p>

<p>Because the "crackedness" of a mushroom's cap is so dependent on 
environmental conditions, I do not recommend stressing it too heavily in
 your identification decisionsâ€”especially among the <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletes.html">boletes</a>, which are notorious for cracking up when they shouldn't. What they think is so damned funny is beyond me.</p>

<p>An <i>ascus</i> (plural <i>asci</i>, which is honest-to-God pronounced "ass eye" in American English) is a microscopic structure in which <a href="#spores">spores</a> are produced. Asci cover the <a href="#hymenium">spore-bearing surfaces</a> of many mushrooms; these mushrooms are consequently members of the phylum Ascomycota.</p>

<p>Spores are forcibly ejected from asci at maturityâ€”often, 
simultaneously across the spore producing surface, creating a puff of 
spore "smoke" that can be visible to the naked eyeâ€”and even, in some 
cases, producing a hissing sound!</p>

<p>The number of spores held in a mushroom's asci (typically 8, for 
species of interest to most mushroom hunters, but sometimes 4, 6, and so
 on) can occasionally be an informative character in identification 
choices. A more commonly needed microscopic assessment, however, 
involves whether the tips of the asci are <a href="#amyloid">amyloid</a> and thus turn blue in <a href="#melzers">Melzer's reagent</a>, like the asci of <i>Peziza</i> species like <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/peziza_michelii.html">Peziza michelii</a></i>, pictured to the left.</p>

<p>With mushrooms, however, "mating" is much more complicated. For our

cultures of mushrooms and attempt to pair them with other cultures in <i>mating studies</i> in order to determine whether they constitute the same species.</p>

<p><b><span size="+0">Clamp Connection</span></b></p>

<p>A clamp connection is a connection between two <a href="#hypha">hyphae</a> (fungal cells). Rather than merely terminating with a <a href="#septate">septum</a>
 (a simple dividing wall), clamped cells involve a little arm, or clamp,
 that reaches from one cell to the next, appearing to hold the cells 
together.</p>

<p>Some mushrooms have clamp connections; others don't. Determining 
whether clamp connections are present in your mushroom will certainly 
help you make progress through many traditional, microscope-based 
identification keys. But it must be pointed out that recent DNA-based 
research has called into question the whole idea of whether clamp 
connections are always "informative," consistent characters. <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/cantharellaceae.html"><i>Cantharellus</i> and <i>Craterellus</i></a>,
 for example, used to be sorted out in large part on the basis of clamp 
connectionsâ€”but DNA has shown us that our arrangements of these genera 
based on clamps did not provide an accurate picture of what is related 
to what, and that clamp connectionss, in fact, don't seem to have any 
correlation to phylogenetic groupings.</p>

<p>Assessing whether <a href="#basidia">basidia</a> have clamp connections at their bases can occasionally be important for identifying mushroomsâ€”for example in <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria.html"><i>Armillaria</i></a>, where the basidia of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_mellea.html"><i>Armillaria mellea</i></a> are not basally clamped as they are in other species.</p>

<p>A cortina is a form of <a href="#partial_veil">partial veil</a>

 consisting of a few spider-web-like threadsâ€”or they can be thicker and

<p><b><span size="+0">Morphological Species, Morphological Species Concept</span></b></p>

<p>A morphological species is defined using the concept used through 
centuries in mycology, until fairly recently: if the mushrooms have 
significantly different morphology, they represent different species. An
 organism's <i>morphology</i> is its set of observable features, which can be macroscopic and/or microscopic.</p>

<p>There are obvious problems with using morphology to define species. 
Where do you draw the lines? There are differences between individual 
mushrooms, of course; when do you decide that a group of mushrooms 
shares enough observable features to constitute a group we should label a
 "species?" How much importance do you attach to each of the various 
features? Is color more important than spore size? These questions (and 
many, many others) lead to an uncomfortable conclusion: it is <i>scientists</i>
 who determine what makes a species, rather than the mushrooms. In other
 words, there is nothing inherently natural about a morphological 
species; it represents merely what the human eye can see (with and 
without the help of technology).</p>

<p><i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_gerardii.html">Lactarius gerardii</a></i>,
 pictured to the left, was originally described in the 19th century as a
 morphological species. However, DNA research indicates there are 
several <a href="#psc">phylogenetic species</a> within the morphological concept of "<i>Lactarius gerardii</i>."</p>

<p><b><span size="+0">Mushroom</span></b></p>

<p>Every so often I get an email asking me if the thing in the attached photo is a mushroom or a toadstool. I want to say: <i>What the fuck does that even mean?</i>
 But I don't. I just click "delete" and move on with my life. "Mushroom"
 isn't a scientific term. I once had a very good teacher who defined 
poetry as "any text someone asks you to consider as poetry." I'm 
inclined to do more or less the same with "mushrooms." They are fungi, 
but they are definitely not <i>all</i> fungi (a category that would 
include, for example, ring worm and the bluish mold that appears on your
 bread)â€”so where you want to draw the "mushroom" line within the fungi 
is up to you.</p>

<p>That said, one good way of <i>understanding</i> mushrooms, I think, is to consider them as <a href="#spores">spore</a> factories. Most of the time, the fungal organism in question spends its time as vegetative <a href="#mycelium">mycelium</a>,
 looking nothing like the "mushroom" thing we're talking about. But when
 the reproductive urge takes hold (that's called "personification"), the
 fungus produces a spore factoryâ€”a structure to make babies and send 
them out into the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps the organism designs a <a href="#stipe">stem</a> or a <a href="#pseudostipe">pseudostem</a>, preparing to lift the spore-producing shop floor high enough so that the spores will easily catch air currents. Perhaps a <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/cups.html">cup</a> is created, or a <a href="#pileus">cap</a>, to hold the floor. <a href="#asci">Asci</a> or <a href="#basidia">basidia</a>,
 the actual spore-producing machines, are erected all across the floor. 
Some organisms increase the factory capacity immensely by increasing the
 floor size with <a href="#gills">gills</a>, <a href="#false_gills">false gills</a>, or <a href="#tubes">tubes</a>. Sometimes the factory adds safety features: <a href="#partial_veil">veils</a> are erected to cover and protect the machinery until the spores are ready.</p>

<p>As soon as the spores are released, the factory shuts down. The 
"mushroom" wilts, decays, and eventually disappears. But the organism 
itself continues, perhaps in the same place, if the mycelium has not run
 out of nutrientsâ€”or somewhere else, when spores land in just the right 
places, germinate, and develop into mycelia.</p>

<p>Pictured to the left is probably the most iconic "mushroom" in the world, <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_muscaria_muscaria.html"><i>Amanita muscaria</i> var. <i>muscaria</i></a>.
 The Mario Kart mushroom. The 
old-farm-woman-bending-over-in-her-polka-dotted-dress mushroom. The 
hookah-smoking-caterpillar-Lewis-Carroll mushroom. <i>Amanita muscaria</i> is one of the more complex and elaborate (and beautiful!) spore factories; it features a long stem, a <a href="#universal_veil">universal veil</a> to protect the construction of the factory, a <a href="#partial_veil">partial veil</a>
 to protect the spore-producing machinery, and the perfect timing 
required to raise the cap up and expand it to break the veils and 
release spores.</p>

<p><b><span size="+0">Mycelium</span></b></p>

<p>A "mushroom" is only the reproductive part of the organismâ€”in the way
 an apple is the fruit of the whole organism, the apple tree. The main 
part of a mushroom is underground, or running through the leaves or 
deadwood (or other substrate); it consists of a mass of <a href="#hypha">hyphae</a>, often visible to the naked eye as a whitish mass or as whitish threads; the mycelium of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/marasmius_delectans.html"><i>Marasmius delectans</i></a>,
 spreading through hardwood leaf litter beneath the mushrooms, is 
illustrated to the left. Perhaps you have seen decaying leaves covered 
with whitish, fuzzy material before; in many cases this is the mycelium 
of a mushroom.</p>

<p>The mycelium is present even when there are no mushrooms. In fact, 
mushrooms spend most of their life cycle as mycelium, vegetating and 
consuming nutrients from whatever substrate they inhabit, only producing
 what we know as "mushrooms" when it's time to reproduce.</p>

<p>Some mushrooms, like species of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria.html"><i>Armillaria</i></a>,
 have mycelia that can stretch for miles and miles; you may remember the
 recent discovery through DNA testing of the "world's largest organism,"
 an <i>Armillaria</i> species in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p><i><b>Basal mycelium:</b></i></p>

<p>Evidence of the mycelium is sometimes found at the base of a 
mushroom's stem; there may be mycelial down or fuzz where the stem meets
 the ground. The presence or absence of basal mycelium is sometimes 
important in the identification process, as is its color. Frustratingly,
 current literature for both <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/laccaria.html"><i>Laccaria</i></a> and <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/phylloporus.html"><i>Phylloporus</i></a> relies heavily on the color of the basal mycelium when the mushroom is fresh. In <i>Laccaria</i>
 one is asked to assess whether or not the basal mycelium was white or 
lilacâ€”but the lilac colors are often faint to begin with, and fade very 
quickly. In <i>Phylloporus</i> the choice is yellow or white, and only slightly easier to determine.</p><p><i><b>Rhizoids, rhizomorphs:</b></i></p>

<p>Mycelial cords or strands, called "rhizoids" or "rhizomorphs," are 
found in some species, and their presence sometimes helps in 
identification decisions. See the page for <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_mellea.html">Armillaria mella</a></i> for an illustration of its large, black, conspicuous rhizomorphs, and see the illustrations on the page for <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/stropharia_hardii.html"><i>Stropharia hardii</i></a> for smaller, more typical, white rhizomorphs.</p>

<p>Mycelium is not always as obvious as it is in the <i>Marasmius</i> 
photo to the left; to view the basal mycelium of a mushroom you must be 
sure to include the stem base when you pick itâ€”and digging around in the
 substrate with a pocket knife is often necessary to find rhizomorphs.</p>

<p>Mushrooms that are mycorrhizal are involved in a symbiotic (mutually 
beneficial) relationship with the tiny rootlets of plantsâ€”usually trees.
 The <a href="#hypha">hyphae</a> of the mushroom's <a href="#mycelium">mycelium</a> surround the tree rootlets with a sheath (called a <i>mycorrhiza</i>),
 and the mushroom helps the tree absorb water and nutrients while the 
tree provides sugars and amino acids to the mushroom. The organisms may 
need each other to survive.
</p><p>(Strictly speaking, the mushrooms I'm calling "mycorrhizal" are <i>ectomycorrhizal</i>. There are also <i>endomycorrhizal</i>
 fungi; their hyphae actually penetrate the plant's rootlets, rather 
than surrounding the rootlets with a sheath. However, endomycorrhizal 
fungi do not produce <a href="#mushroom">mushrooms</a>.)</p>

<p>Not all trees are mycorrhizal. Maples, for example, do not form 
(ecto)mycorrhizal relationships with fungi, while oaks and pines (among 
many others) are eager to partner with mushroom-producing fungi.</p>

<p>Some mycorrhizal mushrooms are very <i>host specific</i> and will only form mycorrhizae with a certain species of tree. <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/suillus_lakei.html"><i>Suillus lakei</i></a> is an example; it partners only with <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/trees/pseudotsuga_menziesii.html">Douglas-fir</a>.

 will associate with many different oaks and hickoriesâ€”and some

<p><b><span size="+0">Phylogenetic Species, Phylogenetic Species Concept</span></b></p>

<p>The reigning way of defining a mushroom species at the time of this 
writing (2018) uses a phylogenetic species concept; species defined this
 way are <i>phylogenetic species</i>. To make a very long and complicated story short, a phylogenetic species is determined by analysis of its DNA.</p>

<p>The science behind DNA analysis of mushrooms is still evolving, and 
changes fairly dramatically with regularity. Not too long ago (like, 
only 15â€“20 years ago), one type of DNA analysis was widely used and 
papers were published based on these findings; now technological and 
protocol advances have rendered these findings quaint and often 
inaccurate. DNA studies looking at one gene were published . . . then 
two genes became the standard, and now at least three or four are often 
required (depending on the mushrooms). In short, we can expect further 
refinements and changes and, with them, revisions of previous findings. 
If this frustrates you, it may be worth remembering that science would 
not be science without such progressions and revisions; it would be 
fundamentalism, instead.</p>

<p><i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/morchella_cryptica.html">Morchella cryptica</a></i>, pictured to the left, is a well-supported phylogenetic species, but it fails miserably as a <a href="#msc">morphological species</a>, since its physical features are indistinguishable from those of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/morchella_esculentoides.html"><i>Morchella esculentoides</i></a>â€”which makes it a <i>cryptic species</i>, since you can't tell it from another species (hence its Latin name).</p>

A <i>trichoderm</i>, illustrated to the left, is a type of pileipellis in which the hyphae arise perpendicular to the cap surface; in an <i>ixotrichoderm</i> the hyphae are gelatinized (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/hygrocybe_glutinipes.html"><i>Hygrocybe glutinipes</i></a>).

<p><b><span size="+0">Pores, Pore Surface</span></b></p>

<p>Pores on mushrooms are tiny holes, just as they are with skin. Many mushrooms produce their <a href="#spores">spores</a> on the inside surfaces of <a href="#tubes">tubes</a>; the mouths of the tubes form pores.</p> 

<p>The <i>pore surface</i> is the surface comprised of all the tube mouths, together, as in the pore surface of <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/rubroboletus_dupainii.html">Rubroboletus dupainii</a></i>,
 illustrated to the left. Observation of the pore surface is often 
important in mushroom identification. The size of the pores (usually 
expressed as a number of pores per millimeter) can be important, as well
 as their arrangement. Often the tiny holes make no particular pattern, 
but in some cases they are clearly elongated and radially arranged, 
especially near the stem. Pores like this, in Mycologese, are called <i>boletinoid</i> (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletinellus_merulioides.html"><i>Boletinelluis merulioides</i></a>
 for an example). In some cases pores are so boletinoid that they begin 
to form ridges near the stem and can approximate the appearance of 
gills; this kind of arrangement is called <i>lamellate.</i></p>

<p>The color of a mushroom's pore surface can be crucial to identifying 
itâ€”but be aware that the color is frequently subject to change as the 
mushroom develops. When identifying boletes, therefore, it is often 
necessary to have collected mushrooms in both "button" and mature 
stages. Whether the pore surface bruises is also an important feature; 
scratch the pore surface with the tip of a knife to see any color 
changes. The pore surface to the left has bruised blue where it was 
handled.</p>

<p>The stems of <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletes.html">boletes</a>
 are often reticulate, and assessing this can be very important in 
bolete identification. The tiny ridges comprising reticulation on bolete
 stems are in fact extensions of the pore surface; the criss-cross 
pattern formed by the reticulation is like the pattern of the pores, but
 stretched out as a result of the stem's growth (if you're having

 Although bolete stem reticulation is often obvious, deciding whether 
some boletes' stems are reticulate, partially reticulate, slightly 
reticulate near the apex, or not reticulate at all can be one of 
mushroom identification's more frustrating tasks.</p>

<p>Spores of mushrooms sometimes feature reticulate ornamentation; for example this is often the case in <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius.html"><i>Lactarius</i></a> and <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/russula.html"><i>Russula</i></a>, where the reticulation, when present, is <a href="#amyloid">amyloid</a>.</p>

<p><b><span size="+0">Spores</span></b></p>

<p>Spores are microscopic, single-celled units produced by mushrooms in 
the process of sexual reproductionâ€”roughly analagous to "seeds." The 
spores are generated on the mushroom's <a href="#hymenium">hymenium</a>, and are produced either by <a href="#asci">asci</a> or <a href="#basidia">basidia</a>, depending on the type of mushroom (officially, spores in the <a href="#asci">Ascomycota</a> are called "ascospores," and spores in the <a href="#basidia">Basidiomycota</a>
 are called "basidiospores"). Spores are launched into air currents; 
eventually, if conditions allow, they germinate to form an organism's 
new <a href="#mycelium">mycelium</a>.</p>

<p>Mushroom spores are incredibly diverse, ranging from boring and round or ellipsoid to star-shaped (like the spores of <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/inocybe_insignis.html">Inocybe insignis</a></i> to the left), cube-shaped (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/entoloma_quadratum.html"><i>Entoloma quadratum</i></a>), needle-shaped (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/cudonia_circinans.html"><i>Cudonia circinans</i></a>), spiny (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/strobilomyces_confusus.html"><i>Strobilomyces confusus</i></a>), prickly-pear-ish (see <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/thelephora_anthocephala.html"><i>Thelephora anthocephala</i></a>), and so on and so on.</p>

<p>Asexual spores, called <i>conidia</i> or, in some cases, <i>chlamydospores</i>,
 are produced by some mushrooms; conidia can germinate to produce a new 
organism through cloning, without sexual reproduction. The presence of 
conidia and conidia-producing structures is sometimes an informative 
character in mushroom identification (for example in <i>Ganoderma</i>). Illustrations comparing conidia and ascospores of the same species can be found on the page for <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/kretzschmaria_deusta.html"><i>Kretzschmaria deusta</i></a>.</p>

<p>Assessing the morphology of a mushroom's spores is one of the 
fundamental elements of mushroom identification; sporal shapes, 
textures, and measurements are often very crucial to figuring out what a
 mushroom is. See <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/microscope_spores.html">viewing and measuring spores</a> for an introduction.</p>

<p>A "spore print," sometimes called a "spore deposit," is a mass of <a href="#spores">spores</a> that can be seen with the naked eye. The white spore print of <i><a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_mellea.html">Armillaria mellea</a></i> can be seen in the photo to the left; because these mushrooms grow in clusters, they often overlap, so that the <a href="#gills">gills</a> sit above the surfaces of other caps during development, resulting in a spore print if the gills reach maturity.</p>

<p>The color of a mushroom's spore print is essential information in the identification process.

See <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/spore_print.html">making spore prints</a> for an introduction to the process.</p>

<p>For centuries mushrooms were classified in great part according to 
the color of their spore prints. While recent DNA-based mycology has 
shown that such arrangements were not necessarily always accurate (for 
example, the white-spored <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/lepiota_cristata.html"><i>Lepiota cristata</i></a> is more closely related to 
the black-spored <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/coprinus_comatus.html"><i>Coprinus comatus</i></a> than it is to many other white-spored mushrooms), spore print color is still one of the best tools in the <i>identification</i> toolbox, regardless of whether the colors represent natural groupings.</p>

<p>To increase the area of the <a href="#hymenium">spore-producing surface</a>
 some mushrooms have developed the ingenious strategy of using tubes. 
Imagine covering the inside surface of a paper towel roll (the cardboard
 cylinder, once the roll is empty) with seedsâ€”then affixing many such

to the number required to simply cover the flat surface itself. Many,

 they are not fused and can be observed clearly as individual, discrete 
tubes. "Normal" bolete tubes are like the tubes pictured to the left 
and, when teased apart, they separate into packed sections. Another tube
 type is <a href="#xerocomoid">xerocomoid tubes</a>.</p>

<p>Tubes are used by <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletes.html">boletes</a> and <a href="https://www.mushroomexpert.com/polyporales.html">polypores</a>, as well as a few other mushrooms, to hold the spore-producing <a href="#basidia">basidia</a>.

<p>Viscid is Mycologese for "slimy" or "sticky." Officially, a viscid surface is thinly slimy, while a thickly slimy surface is <i>glutinous,</i> but the distinction is iffy and often ignored.</p>

<p>A mushroom's surfacesâ€”especially the <a href="#pileus">cap</a> and <a href="#stipe">stem</a>â€”can be slimy when the specimen is fresh, and the sliminess can be important in mushroom identification.</p>

out forest litter stuck to the cap surface. In the illustration to the

<p>The <a href="#mycelium">mycelia</a> of white rot fungi degrade lignin
 in the wood they inhabit, but not the cellulose, resulting in a 
characteristic whitish, stringy decay of the wood.</p>
