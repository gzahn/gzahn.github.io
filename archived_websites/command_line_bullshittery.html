<h1>Helping my students overcome command-line bullshittery</h1>

<div class="summaryBody">
One of my highest-leverage activities when working with students on research is to help them install, set up, and configure software while overcoming the bullshittery of command-line interfaces.

</div></div>

<p>To produce <a href="publications.htm">publications</a> in an applied computer
science field such as my own, a researcher must either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write a piece of prototype computer software that demonstrates the
feasibility of a novel idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a piece of prototype computer software that collects, processes,
and analyzes data to produce novel insights about some topic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many projects actually involve both kinds of activities. Regardless of
subfield, all applied computer science projects require some form of
computer programming (i.e., writing code). All other skills being equal,
the researchers who are better, faster, and more adept at programming
will produce more (and I would argue, <em>better</em>) publications.</p>

<p>What is wonderful about doing applied computer science research in the
modern era is that there are thousands of pieces of free software and
other computer-based tools that researchers can leverage to create their
research software. With the right set of tools, one can be 10x or even
100x more productive than peers who don't know how to set up those
tools.</p>

<p>But this power comes at a great cost: <strong>It takes a tremendous amount of
command-line bullshittery to install, set up, and configure all of this
wonderful free software.</strong> What I mean by <em>command-line bullshittery</em> is
dealing with all of the arcane, obscure, strange bullshit of the
command-line paradigm that most of these free tools are built upon (see
<a href="two-cultures-of-computing.htm">The Two Cultures of Computing</a> for gory details). So

perhaps what is more important to a researcher than programming ability
is adeptness at dealing with command-line bullshittery, since that
enables one to become 10x or even 100x more productive than peers
by finding, installing, configuring, customizing, and remixing the appropriate
pieces of free software.</p>

<p>I've spent the past decade mostly leading my own research projects. This
meant that I did the majority of the command-line bullshittery and
programming to produce the results that led to
<a href="publications.htm">publications</a>, especially ones where I was the first
author. In short, I've gotten very, very, very good at command-line
bullshittery. However, I'm now transitioning into the role of an advisor
whose job is to <strong>mentor students on their research projects</strong>. This
means that my students (not me) are now doing the programming required
to produce my research group's publications.</p>

<h3>The wall of command-line bullshittery</h3>

<p>Here is a common productivity bottleneck faced by students working on
applied computer science research:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Advisor and student discuss high-level research ideas by doodling on
the whiteboard. Awesomeness ensues.</p></li>
<li><p>Student leaves advisor's office feeling pumped and knowing exactly
what they need to do to implement those ideas in code.</p></li>
<li><p>Student tries to get started on programming but immediately gets
stuck since they don't know how to handle all of the command-line
bullshittery required to set up their coding environment with the proper
libraries, tools, and frameworks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Many students get discouraged and turned off from research when they hit
the wall in step 3.</p>

<p>There is a huge disconnect between the elegant high-level ideas
discussed on the whiteboard (while presumably sipping cappuccinos) and
the grimy, grungy, terrible command-line bullshittery required to set up
a computing environment suitable for implementing those ideas in code.
This <a href="http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/1.2/features/chauss/cs.html">gulf of
execution</a> is
tremendously frustrating for highly-capable and motivated students who
just didn't happen to spend 10,000 hours of their youth wrestling with
nasty command-line interfaces.</p>

<h3>Overcoming command-line bullshittery</h3>

<p>As an advisor, I've found that one of the highest-leverage activities
that I do with my students is guiding them through the intricacies of
command-line bullshittery. There is simply no substitute for sitting
down with them one-on-one on their laptop and walking them through all
of the arcane commands to type, what they each mean, and how to
interpret the bullshit output that's barfed out to the drab terminal.
(Senior professors usually have postdocs, research scientists, or older
students train the new students. But I just started this job, so it's
only me right now!)</p>

<p>Throughout this entire ordeal where I'm uttering ridiculous epithets
like &ldquo;git pipe fork pipe stdout pipe stderr apt-get revert
rollback pipe pipe grep pipe to less make install redirect rm rm ls ls
-l ls tar -zxvf rm rm rm ssh mv ssh curl wget pip,&rdquo; I keep
reassuring my students that <strong>this bullshit is not intellectually
interesting in any way ... it's all just a necessary upfront tax
required to enable them to do the actual interesting research.</strong> I've
engaged in so much command-line bullshittery over the years that I can
confidently assert how uninteresting it all is. It's simply an obstacle
to overcome before one can get real work done.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I find that once I go through the initial setup work with
students and have them take notes by copying and pasting commands into
text files, my students can hit the ground running with the actual
programming tasks. Then we get into a nice weekly iteration cycle where
they show me the progress on their software prototype, we brainstorm
more ideas on the whiteboard, they go off and implement it in software,
and repeat. Since we've installed and configured a good set of tools, my
students can be a lot more productive than their peers who don't know
about those tools, thus giving them a motivational boost as well. But
the hardest part is just getting the initial coding environment properly
set up so that they can get started on real work.</p>

<h3>Incidental versus intrinsic complexity</h3>

<p>On a more general note, helping my students overcome command-line
bullshittery is one specific instance of my more general philosophy on
research advising: <strong>I strive to remove incidental complexity for my
students, so that they can focus on the intrinsic complexity of their
research.</strong></p>

<p>Command-line bullshittery is a prime example of <em>incidental complexity</em>:
It has nothing to do with the intellectual content of my students'
research. It arises simply because modern research software development
is a messy jumble of open-source tools tied together by the duct tape of
command-line scripts.</p>

<p>However, I don't think I can remove the <em>intrinsic complexity</em> of doing
research for my students &ndash; the uncertainty of whether a data
analysis is producing sensible results, the details of debugging a
sophisticated algorithm, the challenges of technical writing, or the
sting of repeated paper rejections. Nor would I want to, since those kinds
of difficulties are integral parts of each student's journey to become a
creative, tenacious, and independent researcher.</p>

<p>But no matter what anyone tries to tells you, setting up command-line
bullshittery has nothing to do with one's intellectual worth.</p>

<h3>Postscript: Addressing Internet Commenters</h3>

<p>This article received some attention from Internet commenters on certain
websites. So far I've suppressed my urge to respond on those sites, but
there's one point that I can't let slide. There's no way to respond to
Internet commenters without sounding defensive, so consider yourself
warned!</p>

<p>Two small points of clarification, then onto the main event:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I didn't state it clearly, but I'm actually <strong>teaching</strong> my students
how to use command-line tools during those one-on-one tutoring
sessions. I'm not just setting up their environment for them. Despite
the ranty tone of the article, I'm pretty good at teaching
command-line-fu to students. My students quickly become
self-sufficient and able to learn more on their own.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that command-line-based open-source software is <strong>incredibly
powerful</strong>, although it does take time and effort to set up. I
extolled the 10x to 100x productivity advantages of good tooling
several times throughout the article. And nowhere did I suggest that
we rely only on GUI-based tools.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>OK here's what gets me super pissed. Many commenters presumed that
&ldquo;real programmers&rdquo; should be command-line experts ...
POSIX-flavored command-line experts, to be precise. (None of that
<code>cmd.exe</code> bullshit.) I somewhat agree that good mid-career programmers
are often command-line experts. However, that's not the population I
work with in my job. I work with undergraduate and graduate students at
a university. They are still learning programming and other technical
skills, and I'm confident that <strong>prior POSIX command-line experience is
not a prerequisite for being a good computer science major at either the
undergraduate or graduate levels.</strong></p>

<p>If I worked on research only with so-called &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo;
students who are already POSIX command-line ninjas, as some Internet
commenters suggested, then I will be <strong>stupidly missing out</strong> on
students with great potential but who simply did not grow up exposed to
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Biculturalism.html">Unix
culture</a>.
Even worse, I will be exhibiting biases against women and minorities,
who are much less likely to have childhood exposure to POSIX
command-line culture due to a lack of role models coming from that
culture. This isn't just politically-correct feel-good bullshit ... I
want to work with the best students I can find, so it's profoundly
stupid to disproportionately filter out entire demographics based on
bogus criteria such as prior familiarity with incantations like
&ldquo;<code>nohup tar -jxvf giant.tar.bz2 2&gt; cmd.errs &amp;</code>&rdquo;</p>

<p>More generally, this notion that the only &ldquo;real programmers&rdquo;
are those who have already mastered POSIX command-line-fu before they
leave the university is a dangerous one, and contributes to the
continued monoculture in software-based industries. It's also deeply
insulting to the students whom I teach and work with on research,
especially those who did not happen to grow up with childhood exposure
to Unix-style hobby computing environments.</p>

<p>When I teach my students the principles and details of working on the
command line, they get it. It doesn't matter that they weren't speaking
zsh in tongues ever since they were ten years old. It's simply another
set of tools to learn in the process of working on their research
project. They learn a bit at a time as they work, and after a few
months, they eventually start becoming proficient. Mission accomplished!</p>
