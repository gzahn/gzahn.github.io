# **Bioinformatics Data Skills**
    
## Assignment 6

___

### Here, we're going to work with the output from our Case Study using some familiar tools along with 'awk'

You created a summary file during the ITSxpress Case Study called "ITSxpress_summary_info.txt" that contains filenames, the number of sequences in, the number of sequences out, and the elapsed time.

I want you to figure out:
  
  1. The proportion of passing sequences for each file
  2. The list of filenames that had fewer than 20% of their reads pass ITSxpress
  3. The total number of sequences in those files from #2

The best command-line tool for this is 'awk' which you can read about in BDS Ch 7. Typically, I (and most other?) bioinformaticians, would switch to Python or R for this sort of analysis, but getting a basic grasp of simple awk commands is still very worthwhile. However, we're not going to dive deeply into it.

At this point, it's maybe best to think of 'awk' being a companion to 'sed' in that while 'sed' works with lines, 'awk' works with columns. And it can do math!

___


For the first task:
  
  + Copy the summary file from Case Study 1 to this Assignment_6 directory
  + Use 'awk' to find the proportion of reads that passed ITSxpress for each file (out/in)
  + Add those values as a new column and save that output as Passing_Proportions.tsv


For the second task:
 
  + Use awk to extract a list of filenames that had fewer than 20% passing reads
  + Save that list as "Unsuccessful_ITSxpress_Files.txt"
  
For the third task:

  + Use any method to print the total number of sequences in those files (see BDS p. 160)
  + No need to save this value to a file, just make sure your code prints it to the screen 
 
 
**Be sure you are using good relative filepaths and have a useful directory structure for this project... if you copy the summary output file from Case Study 1 to this assignment directory, be sure to include that code as well, for example!** 

___
  
### **What to turn in:**

  - Documented code used to accomplish each task saved as plain-text file (either .txt or .sh)
  - Be sure to include comments explaining what is going on in your code
  
Upload that plain-text file to Canvas. You'll be graded on completeness, documentation, and readability.
