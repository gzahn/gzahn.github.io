## Assignment 9

Remember that "create a new project" script you wrote at the beginning of the semester?

  + Turn it into an interactive script where the user provides the name of the project
  + It should then generate a full project directory structure based on that name
  + It can be either be interactive or require user parameters
  + I should be able to give your program a name (like "cow_microbiome") and it should instantly build me a blank project with that name and a useful directory structure, including a README file.

___
