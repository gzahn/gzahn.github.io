# **Assignment 10**

It's time for me to take a look at your progress on your final project. You should already have a nice README file, your data, and (at the very least) some draft exploratory code.


## **For credit...**

1.  Push your draft final project code to GitHub
2.  Let me know it's ready for review by typing "Ready for review" into the text box for the assignment on Canvas.
