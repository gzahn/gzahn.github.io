# **Assignment 2 - Learning about file paths via the command line**

In this assignment, you will use R language to:

+ Use relative file paths that are portable between computers sharing a Git repository
+ Demonstrate the use of "wildcards" and pattern matchingto perform actions on groups of files simultaneously
+ Inspect files
+ Explore the RStudio interface and "environment objects"
+ Use for-loops to automate repetitive tasks

**We will cover the commands used here, along with file paths, during class**

___

## First things first, if you haven't done this already...

You need to clone another GitHub repository to your computer. This repository contains all the files (except exams) that we will use for the course. It has several subdirectories, lots of data files, exercises, etc. Most of these can be found on the course website as well, but I want you to have a local copy of everything on your own computer so you can get practice using the command line. 

So, open your command-line terminal and navigate to your Desktop. Then copy/paste the following line to clone our "Data_Course" repository.

```{bash,include=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/gzahn/Data_Course.git
```

This assignment will be completed using RStudio working within an "RProject" in this new "Data_Course" directory.

**All file paths should be relative, starting from the main Data_Course directory**

___

## **For credit...**

1.  Copy and paste the full code used to accomplish tasks 4-10 into a txt file and upload to Canvas

2.  Make sure you include comment lines so it's easy to see which code sections do which tasks

____________


## Complete the following tasks:

1.  Open RStudio and then open the RProject associated with the Data_Course repository you just cloned.

File > Open Project > Navigate to the new "Data_Course" directory > Double-click "Data_Course.Rproj"

You will now be working in an RProject, meaning that all file paths will be self-contained (we will talk about this)

```{r, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./rstudio_img1.png")
```

2.  In RStudio, look at the lower right window and click on the "Files" tab.  You should be looking at all the files associated with this RProject. You can navigate through them just like any file explorer. Look in the "Data" directory to see a bunch of data files.

3.  Open a new Rscript (will appear in the top left window) || File > New File > R script

4.  Write a command that lists all of the .csv files found in the Data/ directory and stores that list in an object called "csv_files"

5.  Find how many files match that description using the length() function

6.  Open the wingspan_vs_mass.csv file and store the contents as an R object named "df" using the read.csv() function

7.  Inspect the first 5 lines of this data set using the head() function

8.  Find any files (recursively) in the Data/ directory that begin with the letter "b" (lowercase)

9.  Write a command that displays the first line of each of those "b" files (this is tricky... use a for-loop)

10.  Do the same thing for all files that end in ".csv"
