Here's an assignment. This will count for two assignments. It's a lot of stuff!

If you can complete the following tasks, you are ready to deal with any Illumina amplicon data that's thrown at you...well, you'll be able to figure it out at least.


There are 6 new fastq sequence files.
Each of these represents the microbiome of a deep sea alga sample. There are two replicates from each species of alga.

Add each command (or series of commands) you used to accomplish each of the tasks below. These may be command line or R code. Whatever works for you. Look into the excellent "fastx-toolkit" (Hannon Lab) if you want to do more in the command-line environment.

Make sure you include all commands... so if you need to load a package, include that code. If you call a command on an unzipped file, make sure you include the code to unzip it first... you get the idea.

Your tasks:

1. Convert these fastq files to fasta format and save them as separate files.



2. Count the number of sequences in each fasta file.



3. Trim each fastq file to the first 150 base pairs and truncate/filter each read at the default quality score of 2. Make sure to remove any reads with uncalled bases (N)



4. Using the error rates in these filtered reads, use dada2 to correct mis-called bases.




5. Create a "species" abundance table



6. Assign taxonomy to these reads based on the fungal database provided "sh_general_release_dynamic_10.10.2017.fasta.gz" (the rdp_train_set won't work since these are fungal, not bacterial reads...we need a fungal database)
If everything is working correctly, this step will take quite a while to run...~15 minutes on my machine.




7. Change the column names in your species abundance table to the assigned taxonomy names.



8. Export this species abundance table with propoerly assigned names as a csv file.
