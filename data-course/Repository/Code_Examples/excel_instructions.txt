1. Import dataset into Excel: https://github.com/gzahn/Data_Course/blob/master/data/wingspan_vs_mass.csv

2. Sort by mass (decreasing)

3. Summarize wingspan and mass values to get min, mean, max

4. Plot wingspan vs mass (Scatterplot)

5. Get slope of linear relationship between wingspan and mass

6. Create a file that has the measured mass values, ordered from highest to lowest (one value per line)
   Name the file "excel_mass_ordered.txt"

7. Create a file that has the slope of our linear model fit (cofficient of mass for linear model) along with summary stats for each variable. 
   Name the file "excel_summary_and_slope.txt"

8. Create a .jpg image file of your scatterplot
   Name the file "excel_scatterplot.jpg"

9. All files should be in a subdirectory called "output" within your Data_Course directory
