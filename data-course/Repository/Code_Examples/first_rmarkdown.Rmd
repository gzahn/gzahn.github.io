## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


This is the iris data set. Our **favorite** ggplot.

_____


This is a list:

  * item 1
  * item 2
    + sub a
    + sub b

1.  a
  + whatever
2.  b
3.  c

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data("iris")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width,color=Species)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
summary(iris)
```

```{bash}
pwd
ls -1
```




```{r}

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
