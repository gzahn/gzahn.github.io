# Intro to ggplot syntax

# The syntax for constructing ggplots could be puzzling if you are a beginner or work primarily with base graphics. 
# The main difference is that, unlike base graphics, ggplot works with dataframes and not individual vectors. 
# All the data needed to make the plot is typically be contained within the dataframe supplied to the ggplot() itself 
# or can be supplied to respective geoms. More on that later.
# The second noticeable feature is that you can keep enhancing the plot by adding more layers (and themes) 
# to an existing plot created using the ggplot() function.


# THE BASIC STEPS FOR CREATING A GRAPH:
  # 1. Initialize the plot by giving ggplot a data.frame to work with 
  # 2. Tell ggplot which "aesthetics" to use, and where (x and y axes, colors, sizes, shapes, transparency, etc)
  # 3. Add "geom" layers to display the aesthetics ... geoms tell ggplot how to deal with the aesthetic layers you chose
  # 4. Add labels, make it pretty
  # 5. Bask in your genious

# Let’s initialize a basic ggplot based on the midwest dataset that we loaded.
ggplot(midwest) # what do you see?

# give it some aesthetics to work with...
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal))  # area and poptotal are columns in 'midwest'

# A blank ggplot is drawn. Even though the x and y are specified, there are no points or lines in it. 
# This is because, ggplot doesn’t assume that you meant a scatterplot or a line chart to be drawn. 
# I have only told ggplot what dataset to use and what columns should be used for X and Y axis. 
# I haven’t explicitly asked it to draw any points.
# 
# Also note that aes() function is used to specify the X and Y axes. 
# That’s because, any information that is part of the source dataframe has to be specified inside the aes() function.

# Give it a geom to map to your defined aesthetics... Basic Scatterplot, in this case:
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() # The "+" tells ggplot to add another layer to our base plot

# Add another geom ... a trendline:
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
# The line of best fit is in blue. Can you find out what other method options are available for geom_smooth? 

# Store your plot as an object to add to...
p <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Zoom in
p + lims(x=c(0,0.1),y=c(0,1000000)) # what did this do?
p + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0, 1000000)) # how is this different?

# Store this new zoomed-in plot
p2 <- p + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0, 1000000))

# Add Title and Labels:
p2 + labs(title="Area Vs Population", 
          subtitle="From midwest dataset", 
          y="Population", 
          x="Area", 
          caption="Midwest Demographics")

# Nifty!  So here's the full function call to make this plot:
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0, 1000000)) + 
  labs(title="Area Vs Population", subtitle="From midwest dataset", y="Population", x="Area", caption="Midwest Demographics")

# Let's make it pretty ####

# Change color of points and line to static values:
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point(color="steelblue",size=3) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",color="firebrick") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0, 1000000)) + 
  labs(title="Area Vs Population", subtitle="From midwest dataset", y="Population", x="Area", caption="Midwest Demographics")
# what else did we change, and how?


# Here's where ggplot gets really cool...
# Suppose if we want the color to change based on another column in the source dataset, 
# we can specify "color" inside the "aesthetic" aes() function.
p3 <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=state),size=3) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",color="firebrick") +
