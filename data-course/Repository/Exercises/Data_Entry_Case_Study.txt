A case study in data entry:

Let's say you sampled the relative abundance of coliform bacteria from two streams every week for four weeks. At each stream, you selected 3 sites a few meters apart from each other.

On each sampling trip, you took a sample from each of the 3 nearby sites at each stream and measured the relative abundance of coliform bacteria from each water sample. 

The idea was to observe changes in coliform bacteria relative abundance over time during the rainy season for these two streams.

Here's your information (below). Enter this into Excel so we can analyze it later.


Sampling locations:
Sewage Effluent Pool (SEP)
Hatchery (HAT)

Weeks:
1
2
3
4

Sites (from each stream):
1
2
3


For week 1, your coliform relative abundances (for each sample taken) are as follows:
SEP-1	0.02
SEP-2	0.08
SEP-3	0.06
HAT-1	0.00
HAT-2	0.01
HAT-3	0.00

For week 2:
SEP-1	0.08
SEP-2	0.10
SEP-3	0.06
HAT-1	0.03
HAT-2	0.00
HAT-3	0.02

For week 3:
SEP-1	0.12
SEP-2	0.16
SEP-3	0.16
HAT-1	0.02
HAT-2	0.08
HAT-3	0.07

For week 4:
SEP-1	0.22
SEP-2	0.24
SEP-3	0.18
HAT-1	0.05
HAT-2	0.09
HAT-3	0.10
