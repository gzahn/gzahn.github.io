## **Lab challenges:**

As we build a foundation of understanding throughout the term, we will apply our knowledge using computational tools on real genomic data sets. Labs will employ common bioinformatics tools to build pipelines that solve problems related to lecture topics. We will cover theory and build computational skills in class during lab days, but each lab will require significant individual work outside of class. There will be a lab challenge associated with each of the topics above.

**Example lab: High-Throughput Sequencing Technologies and data pre-processing**

Given an understanding of the data properties of various sequencing technologies, we will build and evaluate a series of data preprocessing pipelines using a variety of command line tools. Each of these pipelines will be deployed on data sets generated by a range of 5 common sequencing platforms (Illumina MiSeq/NextSeq/NovaSeq, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore). Each student will be responsible for running a set of pipelines outside of class, and reporting pre-and post-processing statistics.
Back in the classroom, we will compile the results from each experiment. Finally, we will compare the outcomes and build a “best-practices flowchart” of the current best tools and parameters for each data type. 

## **Readings & discussions:**

Seminar-style discussions of literature will be incorporated that address cross-cutting themes in genomic data science. These are intended to expand your awareness of current issues in GDS and to spark discussion about improvements that can be made and the implications of GDS in the real world.

    3. Ethics and Policy in Genomics
        - Privacy and security of genomic data
        - Equity in access to genomic technologies
        - Implications of genomic studies for public policy
    4. Emerging Technologies
        - Advances in long-read sequencing
        - Quantum computing in genomics
        - Real-time sequencing applications
    5. Applications of Genomics to Current Issues

        - Pathogen surveillance and pandemic preparedness

## **Cumulative projects:**

**Students enrolled in graduate credit will also be required to complete a synthesis project on a future challenge in genomic data science (topics identified below).** You will write a journal article in the *Perspectives* format for PLOS Computational Biology that addresses one of the topics below and identifies current progress being made in that challenging area. The article should also make supported recommendations for future directions and identify how making progress in this area will improve scientific/societal outcomes for genomic data.

Perspectives in PLOS Computational Biology typically reflect an author's viewpoint on a particular development in science and how, based on current knowledge of the field and the progress in it, this development evidences, or can lead to change in how science is conducted or interpreted. Perspectives are intended to be more prospective than retrospective but require sufficient background to place the points made in context. Perspectives are intended to invite debate and further comment as appropriate. The length should be no more than 2500 words.

**Example Perspectives:**

Markowetz F (2015) You Are Not Working for Me; I Am Working with You. PLoS Comput Biol 11(9): e1004387. (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387)[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387]

Cerullo MA (2015) The Problem with Phi: A Critique of Integrated Information Theory. PLoS Comput Biol 11(9): e1004286. (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004286)[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004387]

Your “perspective” manuscripts will undergo peer review throughout the semester. They will be graded pass/fail after multiple rounds of revisions. The projects are required to pass in order to receive a grade in the course, though they will not be factored into the final grade. See “Assessment” section below.
