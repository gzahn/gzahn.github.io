One fine Hawaiian day in 2015, Geoff Zahn and Anthony Amend set off on
an eight-hour hike. They climbed a jungle mountain on the island of
Oahu, swatting mosquitoes and skirting wallows of wild pigs. The two
headed to the site where a patch of critically endangered /Phyllostegia
kaalaensis/ had been planted a few months earlier. What they found was
dispiriting.

“All the plants were gone,” recalls Zahn, then a postdoctoral fellow at
the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The two ecologists found only the red
flags placed at the site of each planting, plus a few dead stalks. “It
was just like a graveyard,” Zahn says.

The plants, members of the mint family but without the menthol aroma,
had most likely died of powdery mildew caused by /Neoerysiphe
galeopsidis/ <https://peerj.com/articles/4020/>. Today the
white-flowered plants, native to Oahu, survive only in two
government-managed greenhouses on the island. Why /P. kaalaensis/ is
nearly extinct is unclear, though both habitat loss and powdery mildew
are potential explanations. The fuzzy fungal disease attacks the plants
in greenhouses, and the researchers presume it has killed all the plants
they’ve attempted to reintroduce to the wild.

Zahn had never encountered extinction (or near to it) so directly
before. He returned home overwhelmed and determined to help the little mint.

Just like humans and other animals, plants have their own microbiomes,
the bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms living on and in the
plants. Some, like the mildew, attack; others are beneficial. A single
leaf hosts millions of microbes, sometimes hundreds of different types.
The ones living within the plant’s tissues are called endophytes. Plants
acquire many of these microbes from the soil and air; some are passed
from generation to generation through seeds.

The friendly microbes assist with growth and photosynthesis or help
plants survive in the face of drought and other stressors. Some protect
plants from disease or from plant-munching animals. Scientists like Zahn
are investigating how these supportive communities might help endangered
plants in the wild, like the mint on the mountain, or improve output of
crops ranging from breadbasket wheat to tropical cacao.


      Botanical beneficiaries

Bacteria and fungi that live in and on plants can help their hosts in
several ways. Here’s a sampling.


          Plant: Legumes and other plants


            Microbe: Rhizobia

*Effects*: Provide the plant with extra nitrogen, which boosts
photosynthesis and helps the plant produce bitter, nitrogen-containing
alkaloids that defend against plant-eating animals


          Plant: Maize (/Zea mays/)


            Microbe: /Glomus mosseae/

*Effects*: Increase the plant’s root length and water uptake


          Plant: Dang shen (/Codonopsis pilosula/), a medicinal herb
          also known as poor man’s ginseng


            Microbe: Some strains of /Bacillus subtilis/

*Effects*: Improve plant size, chlorophyll content and photosynthesis


          Plant: Black cottonwood (/Populus trichocarpa/)


            Microbe: /Stachybotrys/

*Effects*: Reduce the severity of leaf rust caused by the fungus
/Melampsora/


          Plant: Alfalfa (/Medicago sativa/)


            Microbe: /Sinorhizobium meliloti/

*Effects*: Help the plant withstand freezing

        Beyond the garden store

Certain microbial plant partners are well-known, and there are scores of
microbial products already on the market. Gardeners, for instance, can
spike their watering pails with microbes to encourage flowering and
boost plant immunity. But “we know very little about how the products
out there actually do work,” says Jeff Dangl, a geneticist at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “None of those garden
supply store products have proven useful at large scale.”

Big farms can use microbial treatments. The main one applied broadly in
large-scale agriculture helps roots collect nitrogen, Dangl says, which
plants use to produce chlorophyll for photosynthesis.

Farmers may soon have many more microbial helpers to choose from.
Scientists studying plant microbiomes have described numerous unfamiliar
plant partners in recent decades. Those researchers say they’ve only
scratched the surface of possibilities. Many start-up companies are
researching and releasing novel microbial treatments. “The last five
years have seen an explosion in this,” says Dangl, who cofounded
AgBiome, which soon plans to market a bacterial treatment that combats
fungal diseases. Agricultural giants like Bayer AG, which recently
bought Monsanto, are also investing hundreds of millions of dollars in
potential microbial treatments for plants.

The hope is that microbes can provide the next great revolution in
agriculture — a revolution that’s sorely needed. With the human
population predicted to skyrocket from today’s 7.6 billion to nearly 10
billion by 2050, our need for plant-based food, fibers and animal feed
is expected to double.

“We’re going to need to increase yield,” says Posy Busby, an ecologist
at Oregon State University in Corvallis. “If we can manage and
manipulate microbiomes … this could potentially represent an untapped
area for increasing plant yield in agricultural settings.” Meanwhile,
scientists like Zahn are eyeing the microbiome to save endangered plants.

But before microbiome-based farming and conservation can truly take off,
many questions need answers. Several revolve around the complex
interactions between plants, their diverse microbial denizens and the
environments they live in. One concern is that the microbes that help
some plants might, under certain conditions, harm others elsewhere,
warns microbiologist Luis Mejía of the Institute of Scientific Research
and High Technology Services in Panama City.


        Save the chocolate

Cacao crops — and thus humankind’s precious M&M’s supply — are under
constant threat from undesirable fungi, such as /Phytophthora
palmivora/, which causes black pod rot. But there are good guys in
cacao’s microbiome too, particularly the fungus /Colletotrichum
tropicale/, which seems to protect the trees

Natalie Christian, as a graduate student at Indiana University
Bloomington, traveled to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute on
Panama’s Barro Colorado Island in 2014 to study how entire communities
of microbes colonize and influence cacao plants (/Theobroma cacao/).
Christian suspected that the prime source of a young cacao tree’s
microbiome would be the dead and decaying leaves on the rainforest or
orchard floor.

To test this hunch and see what kind of protection microbes picked up
from leaf litter might offer, Christian raised fungus-free cacao
seedlings in a lab incubator. When the plants reached about half a meter
tall, she placed them in pots outside, surrounding some with leaf litter
from a healthy cacao tree, some with litter from other kinds of trees
and some with no litter at all.

After two weeks, she brought the plants back into the greenhouse to
analyze their microbiomes. She found nearly 300 kinds of endophytes
<http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1858/20170641>,
which she, Mejía and colleagues reported last year in /Proceedings of
the Royal Society B/.

The microbiome membership differed between the litter treatments. Plants
in pots with either kind of leaf litter possessed less diverse
microbiomes than those without litter, probably because the microbes in
the litter quickly took over before stray microbes from elsewhere could
settle in. These results suggest that a seedling in the shadow of more
mature trees will probably accumulate the same microbiome as its
towering neighbors.


        Defenses up

After cacao plants were grown with or without leaf litter around their
roots, scientists exposed the plants to black pod fungus and measured
rot damage. Microbes from cacao-based litter were most beneficial to the
plants, but even mixed litter offered protection against the fungus.

To see if some of those transferred microbes protect the cacao from
disease-causing organisms, Christian rubbed a bit of black pod rot on
the leaves of plants in each group. Three weeks later, she measured the
size of the rotted spots.

Plants surrounded by cacao litter had the smallest lesions. Those with
litter from other trees had slightly more damage, and plants with no
litter had about double the damage of the mixed litter plants.

“Getting exposed to the litter of their mother or their own kind had a
very strong beneficial effect on the resistance of these young plants,”
says plant biologist Keith Clay of Tulane University in New Orleans, a
coauthor of the study.

Scientists aren’t sure how the good fungi protect the plants against the
rot. It may be that the beneficial fungi simply take up space in or on
the leaves, leaving no room for the undesirables, Christian says. Or a
protective microbe like /C. tropicale/ might attack a pathogen via some
kind of chemical warfare. In the case of cacao, she thinks the most
likely explanation is that the good guys act as a sort of vaccine,
priming the plant’s immune system to fight off the rot. In support of
this idea, Mejía reported in 2014 in /Frontiers in Microbiology/ that
/C. tropicale/ causes cacao to turn on defensive genes.

Cacao farmers may need to rethink their practices. The farmers normally
clear leaf litter out of orchards to avoid transmitting disease-causing
microbes from decaying leaves to living trees, says Christian, now a
postdoc at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. But her work
suggests that farmers might do well to at least hold on to litter from
healthy trees.


        Crop questions

Litter is a low-tech way to spread entire communities of microbes — good
and bad. But agricultural companies want to grab only the good microbes
and apply them to crops. The hunt for the good guys starts with a stroll
through a crop field, says Barry Goldman, vice president and head of
discovery at Indigo Ag in Boston. Chances are, you’ll find bigger and
hardier plants among the crowd. Within those top performers, Indigo has
found endophytes that improve plant vigor and size, and others that
protect against drought.

The company, working with cotton, corn, rice, soybeans and wheat, coats
seeds with these microbes. Once the seeds germinate, the microbes cover
the newborn leaves and can get inside via cuts in the roots or through
stomata, tiny breathing holes in the leaves. The process is akin to what
happens when a baby travels through the birth canal, picking up
beneficial microbial partners from mom along the way.

Indigo Ag’s microbial treatment for cotton seeds results in bigger,
bushier plants under low-water conditions compared with untreated
plants. Indigo Ag

For example, the first-generation Indigo Wheat, released in 2016, starts
from seeds treated with a beneficial microbe. In Kansas test fields, the
treatment raised yields by 8 to 19 percent.

Farmers are also reporting improved drought tolerance. During the first
six months of 2018 with only two rains, the participating Kansas farmers
had given up on and plowed over fields with struggling regular wheat,
but not those growing Indigo Wheat, Goldman says.

In St. Louis, NewLeaf Symbiotics is interested in bacteria of the genus
/Methylobacterium/. These microbes, found in all plants, are known as
methylotrophs because they eat methanol, which plants release as their
cells grow. In return for methanol, M-trophs, as NewLeaf calls them,
offer plants diverse benefits. Some deliver molecules that encourage
plants to grow; others make seeds germinate earlier and more
consistently, or protect against problem fungi.

NewLeaf released its first products this year, including Terrasym 401, a
seed treatment for soybeans. Across four years of field trials, Terrasym
401 raised yields by more than two bushels per acre, says NewLeaf
cofounder and CEO Tom Laurita. One bushel is worth about $9. On farms
with thousands of acres, that adds up.

Farmers are pleased, but NewLeaf’s and Indigo’s work is hardly done.
Plant microbiome companies all face similar challenges. One is the
diverse environments where crops are grown. Just because Indigo Wheat
thrives in Kansas doesn’t mean it will outgrow standard varieties in,
say, North Dakota. “The big ask for the next-gen ag biotech companies
like AgBiome or Indigo … is whether the products will deliver as
advertised over a range of field conditions,” Dangl says.

When pressed against a plate of nutrients that support methanol-eating
microbes, a soybean leaf leaves behind spots of growing bacteria. Those
bacteria may help grow more robust plants. NewLeaf Symbiotics

Another issue is that crop fields and plants already have microbiomes.
“We’re asking a lot of a microbe, or a mix of microbes, to invade an
already-existing ecosystem and persist there and do their job,” Dangl
says. Companies will need to make sure their preferred microbes take hold.

And while scientists are well aware that diverse microbial communities
cooperate to affect plant health, most companies are working with one
kind of microbe at a time. Indigo isn’t yet sure how to approach entire
microbiomes, Goldman says, but “we certainly are thinking hard about it.”

Researchers are beginning to address these questions by studying
microbes in communities — such as Christian’s leaf-litter microbiomes —
instead of as individuals. In the lab, Dangl developed a synthetic
community of 188 root microbes. He can apply them to plants under stress
from drought or heat, then watch how the communities respond and affect
the plants.

A major aim is to identify the factors that determine microbiome
membership. What decides who gets a spot on a given plant? How does the
plant species and its local environment affect the microbiome? How do
plants welcome friendlies and eject hostiles? “This is a huge area of
importance,” Dangl says.

There’s some risk in adding microbes to crops while these questions are
still unanswered, Mejía cautions. Microbes that are beneficial in one
situation could be harmful in other plants or different environments.
It’s not a far-fetched scenario: There’s a fungal endophyte of a South
American palm tree that staves off beetle infestations when the trees
are in the shade. Under the sun, however, the fungus turns nasty,
spewing hydrogen peroxide that kills plant tissues.

And although /C. tropicale/ benefits cacao, the genus has a dark side:
Many species of/Colletotrichum /can cause leaf lesions and rotted fruit
or flower spots in a variety of plants ranging from avocados to zinnias.

        Microbes for conservation

Back in Hawaii, after that disheartening hike to the /P. kaalaensis/
graveyard, Zahn pondered how to protect native plants in wild
environments such as Oahu’s mountains.

In people, Zahn considered, antibiotics can damage normal gut microbe
populations, leaving a person vulnerable to infection by harmful
microbes. /P. kaalaensis/ got similar treatment in the greenhouse, where
it received regular dosing of fungicide. In retrospect, Zahn realized,
that treatment probably left the plants bereft of their natural
microbiome and weakened their immune systems, leaving them vulnerable to
mildew infection once dropped into the jungle.

For people on antibiotics, probiotics — beneficial bacteria — can help
restore balance. Zahn thought a similar strategy, a sort of plant
probiotic, could help protect /P. kaalaensis/ in future attempts at
moving it outside.

For a probiotic, Zahn looked to a /P. kaalaensis/ cousin, /Phyllostegia
hirsuta/, which can survive in the wild. He put /P. hirsuta /leaves in a
blender and sprayed the slurry over /P. kaalaensis /growing in an incubator.

Then, Zahn placed a leaf infected with powdery mildew into the
incubator’s air intake. The mint plants treated with the /P. hirsuta
/slurry experienced delayed, less severe infections compared with
untreated plants, Zahn and Amend, also at the University of Hawaii at
Manoa, reported last year in /PeerJ/. The probiotic had worked.

Zahn used DNA sequencing to identify the microbes in the slurry. Many of
the microbiome members probably benefit /P. kaalaensis/, but he thinks
he’s found a major protector: a yeast called /Pseudozyma aphidis/ that
lives on leaves. “This yeast normally just passively absorbs nutrients
from the environment,” Zahn says. “But given the right victim, it will
turn into a vicious spaghetti monster.” When mildew spores land nearby,
the yeast grows tentacle-like filaments that appear to envelop and feed
on the mildew
<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00132/full>.

Emboldened by his results, Zahn trekked back to the jungle and planted
six slurry-treated plants in April 2016. They survived for about two
years, but by May 2018, they were all dead.

Powdery mildew attacks /Phyllostegia kaalaensis/ (left), preventing the
plant from taking hold in the wild. But a beneficial yeast (rods, right)
found on the leaf of another species of /Phyllostegia/ sends out
filaments that attack the mildew (blob in inset) and protect the plants.
Both: G. Zahn and A. Amend//PeerJ/ 2017

“It was still a huge win,” says Nicole Hynson, a community ecologist
also at Manoa. After all, /P. kaalaensis /without probiotics last only
months. And the probiotics approach might apply beyond one little
Hawaiian mint, Hynson adds: “We’re really at the beginning of thinking
how we might use the microbiome to address plant restoration.”

Zahn has since moved to Utah Valley University in Orem, where he’s
hoping to help endangered cacti with microbes. Meanwhile, he’s left the
/Phyllostegia/ project in the hands of Jerry Koko, a graduate student in
Hynson’s lab. Koko is studying how the yeast and some root-based fungi
protect the plant.

Hynson says their goal is to build “a superplant.” With probiotics on
both roots and shoots, an enhanced /P. kaalaensis /should be
well-equipped to grow strong and resist mildew. In greenhouse
experiments so far, Koko says, the plants with both types of beneficial
fungi seem to sport fewer, smaller powdery mildew patches than plants
that received no probiotic treatment.

While the restoration of a little flowering plant, or a few more bushels
of soybeans, may seem like small victories, they could herald big things
for plant microbiomes in conservation as well as agriculture. The
farmers and conservationists of the future may find themselves seeding
and tending not just plants, but their microscopic helpers, too.
