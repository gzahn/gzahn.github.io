## Task 1: Read the companion paper [Wainwright, *et. al*, 2018](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4902243/seagrass_microbiome/items/RGBN7UVQ/item-details){target="_blank"}

This paper looked at how seagrass-associated fungi differed across Wallace's Line. The biology topics that are under investigation in the paper include:

  - Microbial ecology
  - Community ecology
  - Biogeography
  - Biodiversity
  - Dispersal and distribution
  - Conservation and restoration
  
We are literally using the same samples from that paper, but this time, we're going to see if bacterial communities follow a similar pattern as fungi. That's the starting point...so you need to be very familiar with this paper. Probably read it 3 times.

## Task 2: Write down a list of things you don't understand.

No way will you be completely at ease with all of the topics brought up in the paper. Even after reading it 3 times, you will still have questions. For example, can you describe the following terms/concepts:

  - distance decay
  - what does 'scale' have to with with biogeography?
  - RSV
  - community composition
  - *etc.*
  
Bring your list to class so we can pool all of our questions and start making a plan to answer them.
