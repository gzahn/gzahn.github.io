## Task 1: Read this protocol paper: [Zahn, 2022](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5331232/pando_fungi/items/HBEBCYFK/attachment/4MGA6Q7N/reader){target="_blank"}

Remember what you did for assignment 1? Well, you're gonna do the same here. This paper is a different sort of thing though. It's a "protocol paper," meaning that it's essentially a basic recipe for analyzing meta-amplicon data sets. Pay close attention to this because you're gonna do all of these steps on our data set.

So, bring to class a list of things that you don't understand from the paper.

___

## Task 2: Install all the software packages mentioned in the paper and try to run through the code.

The paper includes a full code repository [HERE](https://github.com/Bio-protocol/metaamplicon-recipe){target="_blank"} which has the example data and all the scripts, etc.

Clone this repository and open the RProject. Then work through the scripts on your own computer. Any errors you get are probably due to not having the right software packages installed correctly. I'll help you set up the tricky ones in class, but it's  up to you to install the R packages.

If you do get errors you cannot work through, I want you to *fully* document them in a text file.

Include:

  - The result of `getwd()`
  - The full line of code that gave you the error
  - The exact error message
  
___

The data set used in this recipe is artificially small. It should run very quickly on any laptop. When we get to our real data, that will change, so it's important that you work out any bugs now while it's easy and fast!
