# Course setup

- We have a real data set and some question to address:
  + Do bacterial endophytes of seagrass follow Wallace's Line?
  + What is the core bacterial microbiome of seagrass and does is change with location?
  + Are any individual taxa differentially abundant on either side of Wallace's Line?
- We will use this data set to learn how to process and analyze microbiome data
- We will then write a paper as a class to present our findings for peer-review

>"In 1858 Wallace proposed a boundary line that splits Indonesia in half, running from the Pacific ocean between the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi and entering the Indian ocean via the Lombok Strait between the Islands of Bali and Lombok. This line closely follows the margin of the Sunda Shelf and would later become known as Wallaceâ€™s line when Thomas Huxley coined the term in 1868. Wallace described the fauna west of this line as typically Asian in origin and east of this line Australasian in origin. Several different taxa follow this pattern and it is especially apparent in birds."

Previous work showed, surprisingly, that fungal endophytes of seagrass seem to follow Wallace's Line. We're not sure why, but we need to know if bacterial endophytes show the same patterns. As we start to accrue evidence of this phenomenon, we can contribute to the larger discussion of microbial biogeography. In reality, it's weird to see microbes with the same distributional limitations as birds, especially aquatic microbes. So what is going on? Can we see this play out with bacteria too!?

**Start by reading the [previous paper](https://gzahn.github.io/microbiome_bootcamp/Wainwright_2018.pdf){target="_blank} to get background on this topic. Read it several times... after all, you're going to be doing a lot of the same things for this project (but this time looking at the bacteria instead of fungi).**

Here's an overview of the different sites where seagrass (*Syringodium isoetifolium*) samples were collected

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
dat <- readxl::read_xlsx("./media/SI_Indo_Metadata_CorrectGPS.xlsx")
dat <- dat %>% filter(GPS != "N/A")
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(COLOR = case_when(`East or West of Wallace Line` == "East" ~ "Red",
                           TRUE ~ "Blue")) %>% 
  select(GPS,`East or West of Wallace Line`,COLOR,Location) %>% 
  unique.data.frame()
lat <- dat$GPS %>% str_split(" ") %>% map_chr(1) %>% as.numeric()
lon <- dat$GPS %>% str_split(" ") %>% map_chr(2) %>% as.numeric()
leaflet::leaflet() %>% 
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addCircleMarkers(lng=lon,lat = lat,radius =5,color = dat$COLOR,opacity = 1,label = dat$Location) 

```

## Brief methods

### Study sites

```{r echo=FALSE}
dat %>% 
  bind_cols(lat=round(lat,3),lon=round(lon,3)) %>% 
  select(Location,lat,lon) %>% 
  unique.data.frame() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()

```

```{r fig.width=3,fig.height=3,fig.align="center",echo=FALSE,fig.cap="*Syringodium isoetifolium* (seagrass) meadow -- Image from Wiki commons"}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/Syringodium_isoetifolium_ployant_sous_la_houle.jpg")
```

### Sample processing

16 samples of seagrass were taken from each of 12 locations. The V3 region of the 16S rDNA from each sample was amplified (N=`r 12*16`). These amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq machine with V3 (2x300) chemistry along with 8 sample blanks (Total study N=`r (12*16) + 8`).

### Data analysis

Here's where we come in. We've got raw 16S sequence data from this study and need to process it, explore and visualize it, and test hypotheses. Our final codebase will be deposited as part of the publication, along with any figures and statistical results we develop.

## Logistics

We will use R (and some Bash) along with Git/GitHub to conduct all of our work

Here's an example code archive for this type of work: [Workshop Repository](https://github.com/gzahn/Microbiome_Workshop){target="_blank"}.
