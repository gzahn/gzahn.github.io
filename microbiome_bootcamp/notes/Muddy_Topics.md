# List of "muddy topics" from Wainwright *et al.*, 2018

Mantel test
	- does similarity in community change with similarity in geography?
	- MRM (multiple regression on matrices)
	- distance-decay
	
dissimilarity (bray-curtis vs Jaccard vs whatever)
	- distance matrix

rarefaction
	- random subsampling from every sample to get same number of reads

pairwise distance (genetic)
	- comparing similarity of samples, genetically
	- microsatellite (genetic similarity for a few regions of genome)
	- used less than genomic data these days

how sequencing machine works

why reverse reads suck

OTU vs RSV/ASV/ESV


what is this 'barcode,' what's it do?
	- ITS1 and ITS2

NMDS plot info (R, stress, etc)

R value vs Pvalue

indicspecies (indicator species)

simluations of null models

endemism

why no similarity figure on a map?

metabarcoding (meta-amplicon)

demultiplexed (put each sample into its own files)
