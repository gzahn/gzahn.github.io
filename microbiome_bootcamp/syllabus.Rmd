# **Microbiome Boot Camp Syllabus**

**Course website:** [https://gzahn.github.io/microbiome_bootcamp/](https://gzahn.github.io/microbiome_bootcamp/){target="_blank"}

## Learning objectives

  1. Understand the role of code in reproducible research
  2. Process meta-amplicon data files into a useful data set
  3. Apply the methods of numerical and community ecology
  4. Test hypotheses using meta-amplicon data
  5. Generate intuitive figures that illustrate findings
  6. Prepare a manuscript for peer-review

## About the class

This course is designed to give you the tools needed to analyse high-throughput amplicon DNA data sets. This type of data is common in microbiome research, particularly when one is interested in knowing the relative abundance of bacterial or fungal taxa in a set of samples. We will use a real data set that has not been explored before. In the course of learning the code workflow, we will encounter and explore the principles of many topics in community ecology such as:

  - alpha, beta, and gamma diversity
  - sampling scale and normalization
  - dimensional reduction
  - community distance measures
  - differential abundance and indicator species
  - distance decay
  
We will assume you have a strong familiarity with the R programming language. We will encounter new R packages and object types, but we won't spend any time *learning or reviewing* basic R. This course will require significant external work in order for you to be successful. Our ultimate goal is to produce a manuscript for peer-review and eventual publication.

## Expectations and evaluation

Grades will be based on assignments and code contributions

### Assignments

During the semester, several assignments will be given related to the course material. These assignments can be found on the [course website](https://gzahn.github.io/microbiome_bootcamp/#Weekly_tasks_and_assignments){target="_blank"}.

Examples include:

  - Looking up and reporting on alternative parameters for certain functions
  - Finding and presenting papers about relevant topics
  - Coding assignments such as novel figure generation
  - Annotated bibliographies on background and discussion topics
  - In-class participation in discussion and hypothesis generation

Assignment due dates will be conveyed in class. Late work will receive a zero. We're on a tight schedule if we want to complete a manuscript, so we all need to manage our time well and stay on task.

### Code contributions

Each student is expected to contribute to our final codebase. Comment lines denoting code authorship will be included in the final manuscript GitHub repository. Code contributions will receive points just like regular assignments.

### Writing

Each student is expected to contribute to writing, background reading/research/references, and editing. Students with low participation will not earn authorship on our paper, but grades will not be based on writing. **To be clear, if you fail to complete assigned writing tasks or do a poor job on them, it won't affect your grade... but you won't earn co-authorship on our publication.**



### Grading strategy and scale

Every assignment and code contribution will be graded on a 0-100 scale. At the end of the semester, I will drop your three lowest scores and take the mean of all other scores. This will be your final grade percentage.


```{r}
x <- data.frame(Letter_Grade = c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","D-","E"),
                Minimum_Percent = c(95,90,87,85,80,77,75,70,67,65,60,"<60"))
kableExtra::kable(x) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic(lightable_options = 'hover')
```

For example, if a student received the following scores on graded work over the semester:

100,100,100,90,75,50,0,0,100,100,100,90,90,75,100,100,0,90,100


```{r}
x <- c(100,100,100,90,75,50,100,100,100,90,90,75,100,100,90,100)
```
... I will drop those 3 zeros, and the grade would be an A- based on the mean of `r mean(x)`.

## Legal stuff

**Americans with Disabilities Act:**
Students with disabilities that may negatively impact their ability to successfully complete this course
should let the instructor know as soon as possible, with documentation from the ASD.
"Students who need accommodations because of a disability should contact the UVU Accessibility
Services Department (ASD), located on the Orem Campus, in LC 312. To schedule an appointment, or
speak with a counselor, call the ASD office at 801-863-8747, or for Deaf/Hard of Hearing individuals,
use the video phone number, 886-760-1819."

#### Academic Honesty and Integrity
Utah Valley University expects all students to maintain integrity and high standards of individual
honesty in academic work, to obey the law, and to show respect for others. Students of this class are
expected to support an environment of academic integrity, have the right to such an environment, and
should avoid all aspects of academic dishonesty. Examples of academic dishonesty include
plagiarizing, faking of data, sharing information during an exam, discussing an exam with another
student who has not taken the exam, consulting reference material during an exam, submitting a written
assignment which was authored by someone other than you, and/or cheating in any form.
In keeping with UVU policy, evidence of academic dishonesty may result in a failing grade in the
course and disciplinary review by the college. Any student caught cheating will receive, at minimum,
zero points on that particular assignment for the first offense. A second offense can result in failing the
course and will entail being reported to Student Advising. Academic dishonesty includes, in part, using
materials obtained from another student, published literature, and the Internet without proper
acknowledgment of the source. Additional information on this topic is published in the student
handbook and is available on the UVU website.
Situation of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution
office as, at a minimum, an informational item and potentially as an item for investigation, resolution,
or other.

#### Student Code of Conduct
All UVU students are expected to conduct themselves in an appropriate manner acceptable at an
institution of higher learning. All students are expected to obey the law, to perform contracted
obligations, to maintain absolute integrity and high standards of individual honesty in academic work,
and to observe a high standard of conduct for the academic environment.
The Student Rights and Responsibilities Code, or Code of Conduct, outlines for students what they can
expect from the University and what the University expects of them. It can be found at
http://www.uvu.edu/studentconduct/students/

#### Student Timelines
You are responsible for being aware of and abiding by the dates and deadlines on the student timelines
for this term found at UVU Schedule (http://www.uvu.edu/schedule/)

#### Understand When You May Drop This Course
It is the student’s responsibility to understand when they need to consider dropping from a course.
Dates and deadlines for dropping a course can be found in the student timetables located at
http://www.uvu.edu/schedule/. After the period specified, a serious and compelling reason is required to
drop from the course and would need approval from not just the faculty but also the department chair as
well as the Dean's Office.

#### Incomplete Policy
**An Incomplete (I) Grade is only given due to an extenuating circumstance.** The final decision to issue
an Incomplete grade is up to the instructor. Review the following criteria taken from Policy 523 at for
information on when an incomplete grade can be given:
The student was unable to complete the course due to extenuating circumstances:

* Incapacitating Illness
* Death in the immediate family
* Change in the student's work schedule by the employer
* Other deemed acceptable by the instructor
The student must have completed a minimum of 70% of the required work
An Incomplete Grade form indicating work completed and work to be completed must be signed by the
department chairperson, and turned into the Registrar’s Office at the end of the semester. Incomplete
Grade forms can be obtained from the Registrar's Office.

#### Unofficial Withdrawals
UW will be given only when a student stops attending and completing work before the regularly
scheduled date to officially withdraw as found in the Student Timetable but did not actually officially
withdraw. Rationale: The assumption here is that the student did not realize the necessity to physically
withdraw or made an error in this process, but all intentions of the student were to withdraw from the
class prior to the withdrawal deadline
See also Academic Policies and Standards in the UVU Catalog which notes, "If a student stops
attending (but does not officially withdraw) before the last day to withdraw, he/she should receive a
UW.”

#### Late Work
Late work will not be accepted without a doctors or lawyers note unless previously discussed with and
approved by your instructor. Computer problems, work schedule, lack of internet access, traffic, travel,
or similar do not constitute rationale for late homework. Your instructor has the right to modify their
handling of late work.

#### Individual versus Group Work
All work is to be done individually unless it is clearly identified as group work. By default all
assignments are not group work. This means that you cannot work on assignments with others, even if
your spouse, friends or family, and turn them in as your own. A "group" in this context means more
persons than yourself. You also cannot have others complete the work for you or in part on your
behalf.

#### Inclusivity Statement
We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The
Technology Management department is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that
respects diversity. While working together to build this community we ask all members to:

* share their unique experiences, values and beliefs
* be open to the views of others
* honor the uniqueness of their colleagues
* appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community
* value each other’s opinions and communicate in a respectful manner

#### Academic Freedom
For the purposes of this class, academic freedom is generally defined as follow: For faculty and
students alike, you have the freedom to disagree with the views and statements of others, but academic
freedom should entail tolerance and respect for others, professionalism, and, to the degree possible,
fact-based information. Intellectual vigor is best sustained when the free exchange of ideas is carried
on within an environment supportive of human dignity and self-esteem. For full guidelines see
http://www.uvu.edu/tm/pages/department/acad-freedom.html

**Biology Department Policy**
Students in this class are expected to understand and use proper English grammar, sentence structure,
and spelling. Use of dictionaries during quizzes and exams is NOT allowed. Students are also expected
to have basic calculating skills that include fractions, decimals, exponents (e.g., squares & square roots,
powers of ten) and the ability to solve simple algebraic expressions. In addition, they must be able to
add, subtract, multiply, and divide small numbers without a calculator. Understanding of logarithms
(logs) will be helpful. Course rigor level should be such that the average grade is about a C.

**Student Responsibility**
It is up to you to see that the requirements for this course are completed. This syllabus is your guide to
those requirements. Make certain that you understand what is expected of you. It is up to you to attend
class and arrange for time to complete the readings, assignments, and exams. This course is designed
for biology majors. If you are not reading at a college level, you WILL have difficulty with this course.
There is only one type of “excused” absence, and that is an absence for an official University activity,
such as participation in athletics, not just watching but doing, field trip for another course, etc.
Make-up exams will NOT be given except for a situation beyond your control for which you provide
verifiable (I will verify), written documentation. Family vacations, Illness, family crises, vehicle
problems, legal problems, weddings, not studying, or forgetting to take an exam are NOT valid excuses
or excused absences, even if you tell me beforehand; emergencies are. If such difficulties require asignificant number of absences during the semester, you are advised to drop the course and take it at
another time. You do not need to call me if you will not be in class, I don’t take roll. Class attendance
and obtaining the information for the tests is your responsibility.


___

UVU values and acknowledges a wide range of faiths and religions as part of our student body, and as such provides accommodations for students. Religious belief includes the student's faith or conscience as well as the student's participation in an organized activity conducted under the auspices of the student's religious tradition or religious organization. The accommodations include reasonable student absences from scheduled examinations or academic requirements if they create an undue hardship for sincerely held religious beliefs. For this to occur, the student must provide a written notice to the instructor of the course for which the student seeks said accommodation prior to the event.

The UVU campus has a place for meditation, prayer, reflection, or other forms of individual religious expression as is described on their website.
