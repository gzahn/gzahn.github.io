Major topics to study:

- Know main fungal phyla and their phylogenetic relationships
- Think about the MRCA of fungi, when it diverged from metazoa, and what changes have happened since
- Understand a rough timeline of fungal evolution and transition to land
- Know the fungal growth habits (filamentous, yeast, dimorphic) and consider how these are adaptive to fungal physiology
- What does a hypha look like (subcellular) and how does it grow?
- Be familiar with the annoying fungal terms from the lesson slides (e.g., zoosporangium, eumycota, MRCA, etc)
- Know the major morphology and diversity characteristics of chytrids and their possible life cycles
- Be familiar with chytrid evolution, the paraphyletic nature of the group, and flagellum loss (James, et al., 2006)
