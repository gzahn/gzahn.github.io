Major topics to study:

- Understand types of hyphae and hyphal aggregates
- Types of spores (more terminology)
- Fruiting body terminology (e.g., sporangium, sporangiophore)
- Have a basic understanding of what makes Zygomycetes a group (morphologically) but why it's actually a paraphyletic grouping
- Be able to explain how physics constrains morphology at very small scales and how this relates to hyphae
- Know the two major clades of "Zygomycetes"
- Know the life cycle variations of Zygomycetes
- Be familiar with two groups from the Mucorales: Pilobolus and Mucor; How do they illustrate Zygomycete charateristics?
- What does current evidence suggest about the evolution of the Spitzenkorper?
- What is special about the group known as AMF
