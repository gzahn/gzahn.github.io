Major topics to study:

- Be familiar with the 3 major clades of Ascomycetes
- Understand anamorphs and teleomorphs
- How do we apply a species concept to fungi moving forward?
- Know all the Ascomycete anatomy terms reasonably well (get a feel for the patterns at least)
- Be able to diagram a standard life cycle of an Ascomycete, paying attention to ploidy level
- Be able to discuss how the groups we took a closer look at fit into what we know about Ascomycetes
