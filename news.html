	    <p><strong>August 2025: We are recruiting up to 2 PhD positions to start Fall 2026. </strong>
	    Potential topics include marine fungal diversity, microbial dispersal and microbiome assembly, but there is a lot of flexibility
	    to pursue topics of interest that align with lab goals. I am particularly interested in scholars with experience in
	    bioinformatics, metagenomics, and/or data science techniques. Reach out with your CV and statement of interest well ahead of the application deadline.
