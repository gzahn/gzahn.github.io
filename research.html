        <h2>Modeling microbial community coalescence</h2>
        <p>Transplanting microbiomes is a promising intervention for increasing plant and ecosystem health, but it doesn't always work.</p>
        <p>We are using simulations to better understand the ecological processes that influence success or failure of microbiome transplantation, where a whole community is added to a pre-existing recipient community.</p>

        <h2>Using microbiomes to improve host and ecosystem health</h2>
        <p>We investigate the roles that microbial communities play in shaping plant and ecosystem health.</p>
        <p>Using model systems like <i>Arabidopsis thalliana</i>, and simplified microbial communities, we are tracking how beneficial microbes can alter plant stress response and shape ecosystem conservation and recovery.</p>

        <h2>Global distributions of marine fungi</h2>
        <p>We are harnessing public data and collecting our own time-series of metagenomic data to better understand the diversity, distribution, and functional roles of marine fungi.</p>
        <p>Marine fungi are terribly understudied, yet likely have important contributions to oceanic populations of phytoplankton and the marine carbon cycle.</p>
